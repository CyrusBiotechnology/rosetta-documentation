---
A utility metric that outputs the residue selection in Pose or PDB numbering.  Comma-Separated.

```xml
<SelectedResiduesMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        rosetta_numbering="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **rosetta_numbering**: Set to output in Rosetta numbering instead of PDB numbering
-   **residue_selector**: Required.  Output those residues selected.
