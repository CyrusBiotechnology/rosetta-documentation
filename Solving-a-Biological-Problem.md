==========

Potentially useful experimental data takes many forms. The very nature of Monte Carlo simulation strongly supports the incorporation of any type of experimental constraint, because all you need it to do is allow it to influence the distribution of generated structures.

Rosetta has individual modules to handle particular forms of experimental constraint:
