### PyMOL Side

#### *Setting Up PyMOL*

In PyMOL, run the PyMOLPyRosettaServer.py scripts found in
main/source/src/python/bindings or the main directory of PyRosetta. This will
start the listener and output information about the connection
established. No further work should be required to view PyMOL\_Mover
output from the same computer. We recommend adding

` run /path/to/~/PyMOLPyRosettaServer.py
