Performs loop closure using the Jacobi algorithm

```xml
<JacobiLoopClosureMover name="(&string;)"
        max_cycles="(200 &non_negative_integer;)" err_rot_allowed="(1 &real;)"
        err_lin_allowed="(0.01 &real;)" dq_max_allowed="(0.052 &real;)"
        verbose="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **max_cycles**: Maximum number of cycles per run. Quit the run even if not converged at this point.
-   **err_rot_allowed**: Maximum norm of rotational error (deg) for closure to be accepted as successful.
-   **err_lin_allowed**: Maximum norm of linear error (Ang) for closure to be accepted as successful.
-   **dq_max_allowed**: Maximum change in dihedral angle in each cycle.
-   **verbose**: Setting that determines whether or not to output non-critical information.
