_Autogenerated Tag Syntax Documentation:_

Threads a single letter sequence onto the source pdb.

```
<ThreadSequence name="(string)"target_sequence="(string)"
        start_res="(positive_integer; 1)"allow_design_around="(bool; true)" />
```

-   **target_sequence**: The target sequence can contain two types of 'wildcards'. Placing 'x' in the sequence results in design at this position: target_sequence='TFYxxxHFS' will thread the two specified tripeptides and allow design in the intervening tripeptide. Placing ' ' (space) or '_' (underscore), however, restricts this position to repacking: the string 'TFY HFS' (three spaces between the two triplets) will thread the two tripeptides and will repack the pose's original intervening tripeptide. The string 'TFY___HFS' -three underscores between the two triplets- will also only repack the original intervening tripeptide.
-   **start_res**: Residue at which to start.
-   **allow_design_around**: If set to false, only design the region that is threaded. The rest is set to repack.
