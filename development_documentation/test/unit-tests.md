#What are unit tests?

The purpose of [[unit testing|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing]] (wikipedia link) is to ensure that small chunks of code run _correctly_. 
Writing good unit tests is very important, but something the community has traditionally failed atâ€”our unit test coverage is very poor, and many of the tests we do have are shallow. 
Good unit tests become easy when using [[test-driven development|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development]] (wikipedia link), but this sort of skill at programming is a challenge for the professional biophysicists / amateur programmers who make up our developer base.

TODO: Andrew LF has given presentations on the importance of unit tests / test-driven development - they would be excellent to include here (planned for XRW2015, but ran out of time.)
