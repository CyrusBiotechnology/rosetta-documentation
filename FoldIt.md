# FoldIt

As [[xkcd popularized|http://xkcd.com/1430/]], protein folding is one of the most challenging problems.
FoldIt is a Rosetta-based game which effectively crowd-sources the protein folding problem.
FoldIt relies on human intuition, instead of the typical Rosetta approach (Monte Carlo exploration of conformational space), to identify the native protein conformation.
