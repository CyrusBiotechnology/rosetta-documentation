```xml
<Holes name="(&string;)" cmd="(XRW TO DO &string;)" threshold="(2.0 &real;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **cmd**: expects you to use -holes::dalphaball
-   **threshold**: Threshold value for the filter
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
