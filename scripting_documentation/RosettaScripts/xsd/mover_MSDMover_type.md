Multistate design mover used in the RECON protocol. MSDMover applies linking constraints to a pose based on the sequence of other input poses, then uses a predefined design mover to run design based on these sequence constraints. These constraints are then removed for the next step of the protocol.

```
<MSDMover name="(string)" design_mover="(string)" resfiles="(string)"
        constraint_weight="(real; 1.0)" debug="(bool; false)" />
```

-   **design_mover**: A previously defined mover that will design the input states. Note that since resfiles are applied as a TaskOperation within the MSDMover, there's no need to specify ReadResfile behavior for the design_mover - however all other desired TaskOperations (InitializeFromCommandLine, etc) should be specified in the design_mover tag
-   **resfiles**: A comma-separated list of resfiles to define designable and repackable residues for all states in multistate design. Multiple resfiles can be used for multiple states - in this case the first resfile in the tag will be applied to the first structure, etc. One single resfile used for all states is also supported.
-   **constraint_weight**: The weight of amino acid linking constraints during the RECON protocol. Generally weights will be ramped from 0.5 to 2.0, to allow searching of more sequence space in early rounds.
-   **debug**: Output extra messages during the protocol
