A metric for measuring ... and adding it to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SequenceMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        three_letter="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **three_letter**: Set to ouput the sequence as three-letter codes. Useful for modifications and glycans.  Comma-separated
-   **residue_selector**: Output the sequence of only the selected residues.
