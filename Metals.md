Created 13 March 2014

## Usage cases
In general, there are broad types of task that a user might want to do with a metalloprotein:
* Carry out _de novo_ design to make a binding 
* Import a PDB file and do something to it (_e.g._ design a binder, redesign a loop, relax the structure, _etc._).  This documentation is intended for this case.
