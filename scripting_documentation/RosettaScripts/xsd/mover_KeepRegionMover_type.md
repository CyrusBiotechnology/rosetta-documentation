Keeps a specified region of the current pose and deletes the rest

```
<KeepRegionMover name="(string)" nter_overhang="(non_negative_integer; 0)" cter_overhang="(non_negative_integer; 0)"
         start_pdb_num="(residue_number)" start_res_num="(non_negative_integer)"
         end_pdb_num="(residue_number)" end_res_num="(non_negative_integer)"
         />
```

-   **nter_overhang**: Number of residues N terminal to start to include
-   **cter_overhang**: Number of residues C terminal to end to include
-   **start_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **start_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **end_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **end_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
