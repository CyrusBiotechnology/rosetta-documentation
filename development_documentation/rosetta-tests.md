#A Guide to Running and Writing Tests for Rosetta

Rosetta has 4 sets of tests. Unit tests check particular functions of the Rosetta library. Integration tests track behavior of applications one individual cases. Performance tests monitor speed of Rosetta applications. Scientific tests monitor the behavior of Rosetta applications on a larger scale than Integration tests and with scientifically defined objectives. This page RosettaTests takes the reader through the running each of these test sets and writing of a test in each of these categories.

This page is under construction.
