A metric for measuring SASA and adding it to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SasaMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we calculate the total sasa of these residues.
