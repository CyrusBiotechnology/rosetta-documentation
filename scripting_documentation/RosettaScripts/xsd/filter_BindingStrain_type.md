Computes the energetic strain in a bound monomer. Automatically respects symmetry

```
<BindingStrain name="(string)" task_operations="(string)" scorefxn="(string)" jump="(non_negative_integer; 1)" threshold="(real; 3.0)" relax_mover="(string; null)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   jump: Jump across which to compute binding
-   threshold: Strain must be less than this value to pass
-   relax_mover: Relax mover employed to relieve the unbound state
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
