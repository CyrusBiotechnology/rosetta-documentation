A metric for measuring ... and adding it to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SequenceMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        three_letter="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **three_letter**: Set to ouput the sequence as three-letter codes. Useful for modifications and glycans.  Comma-separated
