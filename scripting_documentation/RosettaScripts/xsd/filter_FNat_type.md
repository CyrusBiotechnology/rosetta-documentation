Filter for poor values of Fnat, a docking metric

```xml
<FNat name="(&string;)" reference_name="(&string;)" threshold="(5 &real;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **threshold**: Threshold for Fnat, a docking metric above which the filter fails
-   **jump**: Jump across which the computation is carried out, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
