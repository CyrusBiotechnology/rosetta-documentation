# Simple Cyclic Peptide Prediction (simple_cycpep_predict) Application

Created 24 October 2015 by Vikram K. Mulligan, Baker laboratory (vmullig@uw.edu).

# Description

The **simple_cycpep_predict** application is intended for rapidly sampling closed conformations of small peptides constrained by backbone cyclization.  These peptides may be composed of any mixture of L- and D-amino acids (and/or glycine).  Unlike sampling performed with the [[Abinitio-Relax|abinitio-relax]]ampling is fragment-_independent_
