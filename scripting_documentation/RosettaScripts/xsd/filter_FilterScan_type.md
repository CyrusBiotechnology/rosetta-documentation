Scan all mutations allowed by a particular set of TaskOperations and test them against a filter

```
<FilterScan name="(string)" task_operations="(string)" triage_filter="(string; true_filter)" keep_native="(bool; false)" dump_pdb_name="(string)" filter="(string; true_filter)" relax_mover="(string; null)" delta="(bool; false)" report_all="(bool; false)" scorefxn="(string)" resfile_name="(string)" resfile_general_property="(string; nataa)" rtmin="(string; false)" score_log_file="(string)" dump_pdb="(bool; false)" delta_filters="(string)" delta_filter_thresholds="(real_cslist)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
-   triage_filter: If this filter evaluates to false, don't include the mutation in the resulting resfile
-   keep_native: Keep the native conformation?
-   dump_pdb_name: Name to which to dump PDBs
-   filter: The filter to be evaluated on every mutation passing triage_filter
-   relax_mover: Mover with which to relax poses
-   delta: XRW TODO
-   report_all: Report all values
-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   resfile_name: The output resfile name; if left unspecified, it will be the input PDB name plus .resfile
-   resfile_general_property: Default resfile command
-   rtmin: Do rtmin on each residue prior to relaxation, which can lead to some energy noise but improves the fit of the mutated residue
-   score_log_file: Name of scorefile log
-   dump_pdb: Dump PDBs
-   delta_filters: Comma-separated list of filters to run
-   delta_filter_thresholds: Comma-separated list of filter thresholds
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
