A metric for measuring per-residue SASA and adding it to the resulting score file..

```xml
<PerResidueSasaMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        output_as_pdb_nums="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **output_as_pdb_nums**: If outputting to scorefile use PDB numbering instead of Rosetta (default)
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we only calculate and output metrics for the subset of residues selected.
