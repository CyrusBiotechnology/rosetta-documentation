Restrict design to not include a residue as an possibility in the task at a position unless it is the starting residue.

```
<DisallowIfNonnative name="(string)"resnum="(non_negative_integer; 0)"
        disallow_aas="(string)" />
```

-   **resnum**: If resnum is left as 0, the restriction will apply throughout the pose.
-   **disallow_aas**: Disallow_aas takes a string of one letter amino acid codes, no separation needed. For example disallow_aas=GCP would prevent Gly, Cys, and Pro from being designed unless they were the native amino acid at a position.
