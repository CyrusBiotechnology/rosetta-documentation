Moves the side chain for a set of residues identified by a task operation in a manner that can be totally independent of rotamer assignments

```xml
<Sidechain name="(&string;)" task_operations="(&string;)"
        ntrials="(10000 &non_negative_integer;)"
        preserve_detailed_balance="(1 &bool;)" prob_uniform="(0.0 &real;)"
        prob_withinrot="(0.0 &real;)" prob_random_pert_current="(0.0 &real;)"
        change_chi_without_replacing_residue="(0.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **ntrials**: Number of trials.
-   **preserve_detailed_balance**: Should the simulation preserve detailed balance?
-   **prob_uniform**: The probability of uniform chi sampling.
-   **prob_withinrot**: The probability of sampling within-rotamer.
-   **prob_random_pert_current**: The probability of making a random perturbation to the current chi value.
-   **change_chi_without_replacing_residue**: The probability of changing chi but not replacing the residue.
