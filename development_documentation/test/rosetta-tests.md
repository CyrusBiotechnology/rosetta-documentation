#A Guide to Running and Writing Tests for Rosetta

Rosetta has 4 sets of tests. Unit tests check particular functions of the Rosetta library. Integration tests track behavior of applications one individual cases. Performance tests monitor speed of Rosetta applications. Scientific tests monitor the behavior of Rosetta applications on a larger scale than Integration tests and with scientifically defined objectives. Information on reading and writing these tests can be found in the pages linked below.
