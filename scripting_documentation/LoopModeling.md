# Loop Modeling

The goal of loop modeling is to predict the conformation of a relatively short 
stretch of protein backbone and sidechain.  As one example, it's not uncommon 
for crystal structures to be missing density in some regions.  Loop modeling 
can be used to predict structures for these regions.  As another, homology 
models often need to account for short insertions or deletions.  Loop modeling 
can be used to predict how these sequence changes affect structure.

Loop modeling in Rosetta is very configurable, but the basic algorithm goes 
like this:

* Inputs:
 
  The inputs are a protein structure and a set of indices specifying where one 
  or more regions to model (i.e. the loop or loops) start and stop.

* Step 1: Initial build
 
  The algorithm starts by building an initial backbone for each loop being 
  sampled.  This backbone is just a starting point for the rest of the 
  algorithm, so it's only realistic in the sense of having reasonable bond 
  lengths and not completely clashing with anything.  Note that by skipping 
  this step, you can use the loop modeling algorithm for ensemble generation.

* Step 2: Centroid refinement

  The algorithm continues by refining the loop conformation in the context of
