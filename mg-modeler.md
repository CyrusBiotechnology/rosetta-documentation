#Mg(2+) modeling
==================================

Application purpose
===========================================

This code models Mg2+ ions into structures, including waters for hexahydrates. It has several modes, ranging from orienting the 'orbitals' for an existing Mg(2+) that define its hexhydrate shell all the way to docking Mg(2+) (and associated waters) _de novo_ into the structure.


Algorithm
=========

The current implementation of Mg(2+) docking is based on an enumerative grid search. 

Modeling of the hydration shell involves placement of 6 virtual atoms marking the faces of a 2 Ã… cube with the Mg(2+) at its center. These atoms mark 'orbital' or 'ligand field' positions where the six waters might go. Orientation  of these virtual atoms and then placement/removal of waters near those positions has been accelerated through heuristics that reproduce enumerative search of those degrees of freedom.

Score functions have been developed for both the explicit water and implicit water case. The latter allows for water-mediated contacts of Mg(2+) to acceptor atoms. See section below on Scorefunction.



Limitations
===========

-   These methods' predictive power have not yet been well tested. These classes should be easy to incorporate into structure prediction & design methods, such as the [[fragment assembly|rna-denovo-setup]] or [[stepwise]] frameworks.  The application is being made public to encourage others inside and outside the Rosetta community to contact developers if they have compelling use cases for _de novo_ Mg(2+) modeling, e.g., in docking Mg(2+) into experimental structures or designing ion binding sites into catalytic sites.

-   Basic calibration of the weights on the score terms has not been carried out (see below for descriptions).

-   It seems likely that incorporation of solutions to the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzman equation, which models regions of high electrostatic potential due to long-range effects, would complement the current code, which (in classic Rosetta style).

Code and Demo
=============

The main code is available in the `mg_modeler` executable, with source code in `src/apps/public/magnesium/mg_modeler.cc`. 

This application is basically a simple wrapper around the classes `MgScanner` and `MgMonteCarlo`, which should be easy to reuse in new applications for prediction and design.

Test files and example command lines are available in integration tests:

```
       main/tests/integration/tests/mg_modeler      
       main/tests/integration/tests/mg_modeler_lores
```      



Input Files
===========

You need a starting structure to run the modeling, in PDB format. It can contain Mg(2+) already to serve as reference locations or positions from which to perturb. Or it can have no Mg(2+) ions if you are trying to dock Mg(2+) _de novo_.

How to dock a Mg(2+)
====================
This is the main mode of use of mg_modeler.
Example command-line (available in the integration test; see path above):

```
mg_modeler -s arich_2r8s_RNA.pdb -out:file:silent arich_mg_hydrate.out -score:weights test_hires2.wts -pose_ligand_res 8
```

This reads in `arich_2r8s_RNA.pdb` which holds the RNA 'metal ion core' in the A-rich bulge region of the P4-P6 domain of the _Tetrahymena_ group I ribozyme. Mg(2+) positions that are within direct contact distance to any electronegative atom (h-bond acceptor) of residue 8 (specified in `-pose_ligand_res`) are tested. Output locations that pass default score filters go to a silent file of the RNA with the Mg(2+) and any waters (specified in `-out:file:silent`). 

Models can be extracted from the silent file into PDB format with the usual extraction utilities (see extract_lowscore_decoys.py in [[rna-denovo-setup]] or [[extract_pdbs]).

Note that during the scan, the two Mg(2+) ions inside the input PDB are stripped out (they can be kept if user supplied `-mg_res`). Their positions are still used to return RMSD values (computed as the deviation of the modeled Mg(2+) position from the closest Mg(2+) in the reference structure).

Other modes
====================
Rather than dock ('scan') a Mg(2+)  into the structure, `mg_modeler` allows access to three of the `MgScanner`'s component functionalities, mainly for testing, as well as a (rather untested) pilot mode for carrying out monte carlo sampling of the Mg(2+) and associated waters.

Component Mode 1. Orient Mg(2+) ligand-field ('orbital') frames
------------------------------------------------------


Component Mode 2. Pack hydrogens in existing waters that ligate Mg(2+)
--------------------------------------------------------

Component Mode 3. Pack waters around existing Mg(2+)
------------------------------------------

Alternative Sampling Mode. Sample Mg(2+) & water position by monte carlo.
-------------------------------------------------------

 OR
-secstruct_file          file containint secondary structure on top line (can have sequence or anything else on later lines)

-extra_minimize_res      positions that may be in input residues (specified in -s or -silent) but should be minimized
-extra_minimize_chi_res  positions that may be in input residues (specified in -s or -silent) but side-chains should be minimized
-virtual_anchor          poorly named; creates a virtual anchor necessary for rigid-body sampling of separate parts of the pose
-obligate_pair           specify pairs of positions that must be in base pairs (perhaps at the expense of transient chain breaks elsewhere)
-obligate_pair_explicit  like obligate pair, but specify sets of 5: <pos1> <pos2> <W/H/S> <W/H/S> <A/P>, where W/H/S means Watson-Crick/Hoogsteen/sugar edge; and A/P means antiparallel/parallel base normals.
