# Generalized Kinematic Closure
By Vikram K. Mulligan, Baker laboratory.  Documentation written 4 April 2014.
The algorithm described here currently exists in the **collab/cycpep** and **vmullig/sidechainKIC** development branches, but will be checked into master shortly.  At that time, this documentation will be added to the primary documentation.

## Short summary
GeneralizedKIC is a generalization of the existing kinematic closure machinery.  The generalized version works with arbitrary backbones, and with loops that go through side-chains, ligands, etc.
