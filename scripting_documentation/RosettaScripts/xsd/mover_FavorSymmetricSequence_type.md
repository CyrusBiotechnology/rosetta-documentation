Add ResidueTypeLinkingConstraints to the pose such that a symmetric sequence (CATCATCAT)will be favored during design. You should add this mover before sequence design is performed.

```
<FavorSymmetricSequence name="(string)" penalty="(real)" symmetric_units="(positive_integer)" />
```

-   penalty: Penalty applied to a pair of asymmetric residues
-   symmetric_units: Number of symmetric units in the sequence. It should be a value of 2 or greater
