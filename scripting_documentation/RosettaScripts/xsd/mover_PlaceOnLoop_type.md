```

-   host_chain: Chain where hotspot stub residues should be placed on a loop, numbered from 1 sequentially
-   loop_begin: Beginning residue of loop, in seqpos (Rosetta) numbering
-   loop_end: Ending residue of loop, in seqpos (Rosetta) numbering
-   minimize_toward_stub: reclose the loop using minimization to get the stub exactly right
-   stubfile: Input stubfile from which to draw samples
-   score_high: XRW TO DO
-   score_low: XRW TO DO
-   closing_attempts: Attempt to close the loop this many times before giving up
-   shorten_by: Shorten loop by this many residues (multiple options may be provided, will be selected randomly)
-   lengthen_by: Lengthen loop by this many residues (multiple options may be provided, will be selected randomly)
