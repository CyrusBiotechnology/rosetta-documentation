# TCRmodel
The TCRmodel server has three main stages:

Template identification -  Template structures are identified from known TCR CDR loops and framework regions

Grafting -  Models are assembled by grafting identified template loops onto framework regions

Refinement -  Side chains and backbone of models are minimized using the fast "relax" protocol in Rosetta, and if specified by the user, CDR3 loops subjected to additional cycles of backbone refinement, using kinematic closure loop modeling (Refine: refinement, Remodel: rebuilding + refinement)

The database of template TCR structures is updated from the Protein Data Bank on a monthly basis, and currently includes several hundred crystal structures representing over 100 unique TCRs. If no template is identified among TCR structures, CDR loops are obtained from antibody crystal structures, or are modeled de novo.
