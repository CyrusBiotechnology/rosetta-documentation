InterfaceScoreCalculator calculates a myriad of ligand specific scores and appends them to the output file. After scoring the complex the ligand is moved 1000 Ã… away from the protein. The model is then scored again. An interface score is calculated for each score term by subtracting separated energy from complex energy.

```xml
<InterfaceScoreCalculator name="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" native="(&string;)" normalize="(&string;)"
        compute_grid_scores="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **chains**: (REQUIRED) Comma separated chains to dock.
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) Scorefxn of choice.
-   **native**: This is your native pdb without interface mutations. If a native structure is specified, 4 additional score terms are calculated: ligand_centroid_travel, ligand_radious_of_gyration, ligand_rms_no_super, and ligand_rms_with_super.
-   **normalize**: The normalization function you wish to use.
-   **compute_grid_scores**: If compute_grid_scores is true, the scores for each grid will be calculated. This may result in the regeneration of the scoring grids, which can be slow.
