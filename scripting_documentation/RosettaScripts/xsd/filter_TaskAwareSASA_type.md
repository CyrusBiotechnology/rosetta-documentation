Calculates SASA for a set of residues defined by TaskOperations.

```
<TaskAwareSASA name="(string)" threshold="(real; 0)" designable_only="(bool; false)" sc_only="(bool; false)" probe_radius="(real; 2.2)" jump="(non_negative_integer; 0)" task_operations="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   threshold: Returns true if the set of residues defined by the TaskOperations have a combined SASA higher than the threshold, false otherwise. Default threshold is 0 so that all structures will pass if a threshold is not explicitly specified.
-   designable_only: If true, only designable positions are calculated...?
-   sc_only: Make backbone atoms virtual to find sidechain-only values?
-   probe_radius: Probe radius for calculating the solvent accessible surface area. Note: the default is larger than the typical used to represent water of 1.4 angstroms, but has been found to work well with the other default parameters for protein redesign purposes.
-   jump: If a jump has been provided by the user, separate the pose by that jump.
-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
