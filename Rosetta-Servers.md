Rosetta servers
===================

The [[RosettaCommons|https://www.rosettacommons.org/about]] (the group of labs that maintain Rosetta) maintains a number of servers for free public academic use. Commercial use, or paid use on cloud resources, is not supported at this time.

[[_TOC_]]

* [ROSIE](http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/) is a server that many several Rosetta applications through a simple web interface.
It is perfect for use by those new to Rosetta.
Despite ROSIE's variety it offers only a slice of Rosetta's full functionality.
Because this is a free public resource, computer time is limited, but runs can be downloaded and used to build Rosetta jobs on other resources.

* [ROBETTA](http://robetta.bakerlab.org/) (Robot-Rosetta) is a server that provides _ab initio_ folding and structure prediction, as well as fragment selection for local runs of Rosetta.
It also provides interface alanine scanning and DNA interface residue scanning.

* The [Rosetta Design Server](http://rosettadesign.med.unc.edu/) provides access to Rosetta's [[fixbb]] fixed-backbone design protocol.

* The [Backrub Server](https://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/backrub/cgi-bin/rosettaweb.py?query=index) provides [[backrub]] ensembles, as well as alanine scanning.

* The [FlexPepDock server](http://flexpepdock.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il/) provides [[FlexPepDock]]. 

* [RosettaDiagrams](http://www.rosettadiagrams.org/) provides a graphical interactive service to produce [[RosettaScripts]] XML files, with some ability to run the scripts as well.
