Computes the energetic strain in a bound monomer. Automatically respects symmetry

```xml
<BindingStrain name="(&string;)" task_operations="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        threshold="(3.0 &real;)" relax_mover="(null &string;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **jump**: Jump across which to compute binding
-   **threshold**: Strain must be less than this value to pass
-   **relax_mover**: Relax mover employed to relieve the unbound state
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
