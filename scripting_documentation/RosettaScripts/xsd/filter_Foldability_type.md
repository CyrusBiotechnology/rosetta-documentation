This filter is designed as a means of quantifying Nobu and Rie's "foldability" metric, in which a structure is refolded several times and compared to the desired structure.

```
<Foldability name="(string)" tries="(non_negative_integer; 100)"
        selector="(string)" start_res="(non_negative_integer)"
        end_res="(non_negative_integer)" motif="(string)"
        ignore_pose_abego="(bool)" use_sequence="(bool)" output_poses="(bool)"
        distance_threshold="(real)" scorefxn="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **tries**: number of attempted fragment insertions
-   **selector**: (start_res;end_res) and selector are mutually exclusive
-   **start_res**: The N-terminal residue of the piece of backbone to be rebuilt. (start_res;end_res) and selector are mutually exclusive
-   **end_res**: The C-terminal residue of the piece of backbone to be rebuilt. (start_res;end_res) and selector are mutually exclusive
-   **motif**: The secondary structure + abego to be used for the backbone region to be rebuilt. Taken from input pose if not specified.
-   **ignore_pose_abego**: Requires motif to be specified
-   **use_sequence**: Use sequence for fragment insertion mover
-   **output_poses**: dump pdbs
-   **distance_threshold**: A folding attempt is considered successful if the end of the refolded region is at most distance_threshold from its original location.
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
