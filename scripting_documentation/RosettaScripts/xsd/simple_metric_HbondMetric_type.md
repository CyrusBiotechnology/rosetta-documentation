A metric to report the total h-bonds residues from a selection to all [OTHER] residues, or from a set of residues to another set of residues.  If No selection is given, will report ALL vs ALL.

 TIPS:
  Use the SummaryMetric to get total hbonds of a selection or total number of residues having some number of hbonds. . See the WaterMediatedBridgedHBondMetric for water-mediated h-bonds.

  It is recommended to use -beta (-beta_nov16 and -genpot) as your scorefunction for better detection of hbonds.

  By default does not report self-self hbonds (but this is an option).

```xml
<HbondMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        output_as_pdb_nums="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        residue_selector2="(&string;)" include_self="(false &bool;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Allows multiple configured SimpleMetrics of a single type to be called in a single RunSimpleMetrics and SimpleMetricFeatures. 
 The custom_type name will be added to the data tag in the scorefile or features database.
-   **output_as_pdb_nums**: If outputting to scorefile use PDB numbering+chain instead of Rosetta (1 - N numbering)
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we only calculate and output metrics for the subset of residues selected.
-   **residue_selector2**: Optional Selector to measure hbonds between residues in each selection, instead of ANY between selector1 and the pose.  If NO selector is given, will calculate hbonds to all [OTHER] residues.
-   **include_self**: Set to include self-self hydrogen bonds: Ex: resJ - resJ
