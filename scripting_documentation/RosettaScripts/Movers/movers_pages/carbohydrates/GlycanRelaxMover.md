Description
===========

Glycan Relax aims to sample potential conformational states of carbohydrates, either attached to a protein or free.  It is extremely fast.  Currently, it uses a few strategies to do so, using statistics from various papers, the CHI (CarboHydrate Intrinsic) energy term, and a new framework for backbone dihedral sampling. Conformer statistics adapted from Schief lab Glycan Relax app, originally used/written by Yih-En Andrew Ban.

It can model glycans from ideal geometry, or refine already-modeling glycans.  This is still an in-development application.

See [[Working With Glycans | WorkingWithGlycans ]] for more.

Algorithm
=======
See [[GlycanRelax]] (application documentation) for the current algorithm.

Usage
=====

```
<GlycanRelaxMover residue_selector= selector/>
```


### Common Settings

_rounds_ &size default=75 
- Number of rounds to use for Glycan Relax. 
         Total rounds is this # times number of glycan residues in movemap

_scorefxn_ &score
- Particular scorefunction to use.  
         Passing -include_sugars to Rosetta, will add sugar-specific terms to the default score funciton.
         If you are passing your own scorefxn, make sure to add these (currently only sugar_bb at a weight of 1.
- default=always the rosetta_default (Currently Talaris1014)

_ref_pose_name_ &name
- Set a specific refpose name to use. Useful if trimming protein as well as building up or down glycans.



### Residue Selection
_residue_selector_ &selector_name
- Use residue selectors to select residues for which we will model.  
 
_MoveMap_ & mm
- Use a MoveMap to select residues for which we will model. See the [[FastRelaxMover]] documentation for more.

_branch_ &string

_branches_ &string,&string,&string
- Specify a particular resnum for which we will model everything 'out' from this for that glycan(s)  
         Still useful, but much functionality has been superseeded by the
         GlycanResidueSelector in combination with the GlycanTreeSelector 
 
_task_operations_ & operations
- Set a particular set of task operations to use for packing.  Yes, design is actually possible here.
- default = Glycan OH groups and Neighbor protein residues


### Starting Glycans

_random_start_ &bool default=false
- Randomize the starting glycans set to move before the protocol.  Used to create increased diversity.  
         This is recommended if doing de-novo glycan modeling, 
         or you have just glycosylated using the SimpleGlycosylateMover.

_sugar_bb_start_ &bool default=false
- Randomize the starting glycans using sugar bb data before the protocol.  
         Results in generally better structures than random start, but lower quantity of great poses.  
         IE - less crap, but less enrichment of super-great structures.


### Fine Control

_kt_ &real default=2.0
- KT for GlycanRelaxMover
  
_pymol_movie_ &bool default=false
- Make a movie of accepts and trials by outputing frames 
         (as pymol does not currently recieve the needed LINK/CONNECT records when 
         sent through the pymol mover/observer system). 
  
_final_min_ &bool default=true
- Do a final minimization of glycans after glycan relax protocol?
