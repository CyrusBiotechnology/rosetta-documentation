## CavityVolume

Uses Will Sheffler's packing code to estimate the total volume of intra-protein voids. The value returned is the sum of volumes of the computed cavities in Angstroms <sup>3</sup>. A value of 20 is approximately equal to the volume of a carbon atom. This filter currently has no options or threshold, and currently always returns true, but that is likely to change in the future.
