Design residues with selected amino acids depending on the local secondary structure. The secondary structure at each residue is determined by DSSP (or read from a blueprint file).

```
<DsspDesign name="(string)" blueprint="(string)" >
    <Loop aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <Strand aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <Helix aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <HelixStart aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <HelixCapping aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <Nterm aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <Cterm aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
    <all aa="(string)" append="(string)" exclude="(string)" />
</DsspDesign>
```

-   blueprint: a blueprint file which specifies the secondary structure at each position
