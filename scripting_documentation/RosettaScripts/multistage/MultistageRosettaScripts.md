#MultistageRosettaScripts

###Description

Multistage Rosetta Scripts (MRS) allows the user to explore
large sample spaces using adaptive sampling.
Traditional Rosetta Scripts does not have a built-in interface
that allows the user to filter trajectories based on their global ranking.
Traditional Rosetta Script filters rely on predetermined filtration cutoffs.
It is often difficult to predict the correct cutoff to use without first
running the script, so these filter cutoffs tend to be conservative in practice.
