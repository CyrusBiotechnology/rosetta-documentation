#Features reporter overview

These applications are meant for researchers interested in evaluating structure prediction protocols with respect to local structural features or researchers interested in improving an structural biology energy function.

We provide tutorials that describe an example of a concrete task as a way to orient new users.
At the end of each tutorial there references where more detailed information is provided.
If there is a specific tutorial you think or would like to see here, please add it to the list at the bottom of requested tutorials!

We also document individual FeatureReporters and R scripts useful for post-processing data.
