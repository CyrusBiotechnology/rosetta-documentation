-   fa_scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   cen_scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   fragments: Name of fragment file for fragment-based loop modeling.
-   add_chainbreakterm: Penalize chain break in score calculation.
-   cutpoint_based: Use cutpoint during loop moelding.
-   use_kic: Use KIC for loop modeling.
-   idealize: Sample only ideal bb torsions. Faster. idealize="false" is being ignored!
-   use_ccd: Use CCD for loop modeling.
-   trials_ccd: XRW TO DO
-   secstrct: File with secondary struct assignment for each residue in chain(s)
-   template_pdb: Template pdb file
-   chain_num: Comma-separated list of chain IDs. NOTE: chains have to be consecutive


For subtag Seeds: 

-   begin: Beginning of seed fragments (residue number)
-   end: End of seed fragment (residue number)
