Simple RMSD filter for the whole pose, or at least a single chain

```
<RmsdSimple name="(string)" reference_name="(string)" chain="(char)" threshold="(real)"
         align="(bool)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **chain**: Chain for RMSD calculation
-   **threshold**: Threshold of RMSD above which the filter fails
-   **align**: If align is true, we do RMSD; if it is false, we don't actually do any alignment, just calculating the distance between pose and reference.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
