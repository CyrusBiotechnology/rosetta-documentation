A metric for measuring SASA and adding it to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SasaMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we calculate the total sasa of these residues.
