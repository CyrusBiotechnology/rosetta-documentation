<!-- --- title: Silent File -->

Silent file is a compact format file which stores information from multiple structures. Silent files can be generated by many Rosetta simulations. Such as Abintio and Ligand Docking. You also can use silent file tools to combine regular pdb files to be binary format silent file to save computer storage spaces. We will briefly introduce silent file format here.

Protein Silent Struct is usually seen in the Abinitio outputs.

    Colunms 64-98                 Chi angle real data if possible

Binary Silent Struct File is very useful to compress multiple pdbs and save computer spaces.
