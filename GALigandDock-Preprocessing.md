This page provides how to preprocess your input for setting up GALigandDock runs.

### 1. Make a proper mol2 file
Prepare a "proper" mol2 file starting from either SMILES string or a mol2 file.
(see below "HOW-TO-MAKE-PROPER-MOL2" if you are not sure if yours is "legit")

### 2. Partial charge assignment
Add AM1-BCC partial charge to your mol2file. You can skip this stage if you are going to 
run partial charge calculation through stage3; this machinery in mol2genparams.py is still under progress
and we recommend running external softwares listed below: 

#### Using UCSF chimera
- open UCSF chimera (download it if you don't have it; its free)
- tools -> Add Charges -> Switch "other residues" to "AM1-BCC" -> click OK -> assign proper Net charge -> OK

#### Using antechamber from AMBER tools
- 

### 3. Making a generic-atom-type-version Rosetta params file

$ROSETTA/source/scripts/python/public/generic_potential/mol2genparams.py -s [your.mol2]
will give you
- [your].params and
- [your]_0001.pdb; a ligand pdb file with coordinates copied from input mol2 file.

```html
Usage: python mol2genparams.py [-s mol2file or -l mol2filelist] [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s INPUTS, --inputs=INPUTS
  -l L                  
  --nm=RESNAME, --resname=RESNAME
                        Residue name
  --auto_nm=AUTO_RESPREFIX
                        Automatically rename resname starting with argument;
                        default L[00-99]
  --am1bcc              Calculate am1bcc charge (currently am1 part only; bcc will be added soon)
  --prefix=PREFIX       Prefix of output names
                        (prefix.params,prefix_0001.pdb), default as the prefix
                        of input mol2 file
  --debug               Report verbose output for debugging
  --no_output           Do not report params or pdb
  --funcgrp             Report functional group assignment to stdout
  --elec_cp_rep         Report elec-countpair info to [prefix].elec_cp_ref
  --elec_grpdef         Report elec-grp-definition info to [prefix].grpref
  --puckering_chi       Define ring puckering torsions as rotatable CHI
  --amide_chi           Define amide as rotatable CHI
  --freeze_ringring     Define  as rotatable CHI
```

**Notes:**

* Requires numpy and scipy installed in order to run the script.
* Requires numba installation for --am1bcc option. This can be readily installed through Anaconda.

### 4.Making an input holo pdb file
- HETATM lines of the ligand you want to dock is located at the last part of the file;
- which also means HETATM lines for any cofactor(s) should locate above the ligand of your interest
- your ligand position is at a reasonable 3-D location inside the pocket

### NOTES
####No conformer generation required
Skip conformer generation! You don't need it anymore. Any single conformation is enough as input and docking tool will take care of various conformers even beyond what could be generated by typical conformer generation tools.

#### HOW TO MAKE A PROPER MOL2 FILE
1-1. if input is pdb:
~hpark/bin/obabel -i pdb my.pdb -o mol2 -O my.mol2 

(optional) Attach hydrogens using OpenBabel if missing:
~hpark/bin/obabel -i mol2 noH.mol2 -o mol2 -O yesH.mol2 -p [pH of your interest; usually 7.0]

1-2.
