Calculates the Lawrence and Coleman shape complementarity using a port of the original Fortran code from CCP4's sc. Symmetry aware. Can be calculated across a jump (default behavior) or the two surfaces can be specified by explicitly providing lists of the residues making up each surface.

```
<ShapeComplementarity name="(string)" min_sc="(real; 0.5)"
        min_interface="(real; 0)" verbose="(bool; false)" quick="(bool; false)"
        jump="(integer; 1)" write_int_area="(bool; false)"
        sym_dof_name="(string)" multicomp="(bool; false)" residues1="(string)"
        residues2="(string)" residue_selector1="(string)"
        residues_selector2="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **min_sc**: The filter fails if the calculated sc is less than the given value.
-   **min_interface**: The filter fails is the calculated interface area is less than the given value.
-   **verbose**: If true, print extra calculation details to the tracer.
-   **quick**: If true, do a quicker, less accurate calculation by reducing the density.
-   **jump**: For non-symmetric poses, which jump over which to calculate the interface.
-   **write_int_area**: If true, write interface area to scorefile.
-   **sym_dof_name**: For symmetric poses, which dof over which to calculate the interface.
-   **multicomp**: If true, multiple component system. If false, single component system.
-   **residues1**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface (both symmetric and non-symmetric poses.)
-   **residues2**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface (both symmetric and non-symmetric poses.)
-   **residue_selector1**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **residues_selector2**: Explicitly set which residues are on each side of the interface using residue_selectors.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
