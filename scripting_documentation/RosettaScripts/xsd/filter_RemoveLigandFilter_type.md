Check if the ligand's pocket is stable by removing the ligand, relaxing the structure and calculating rms to the starting structure.

```
<RemoveLigandFilter name="(string)" threshold="(real; 3.0)" mover="(string)"
        filter="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **threshold**: XSD XRW: TO DO score threshold
-   **mover**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **filter**: XSD XRW: TO DO rmsd type filter
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
