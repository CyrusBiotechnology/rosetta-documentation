## ForceDisulfides

Set a list of cysteine pairs to form disulfides and repack their surroundings. Useful for cases where the disulfides aren't recognized by Rosetta. The disulfide fixing uses Rosetta's standard, Conformation.fix\_disulfides( .. ), which only sets the residue type to disulfide. The repacking step is necessary to realize the disulfide bond geometry.

```
<ForceDisulfides name="&string" scorefxn=(score12 &string) disulfides=(&list of residue pairs)/>
```

-   scorefxn: scorefunction to use for repacking. Repacking takes place in 6A shells around each affected cystein.
-   disulfides: For instance: 23A:88A,22B:91B. Can also take regular Rosetta numbering as in: 24:88,23:91.
