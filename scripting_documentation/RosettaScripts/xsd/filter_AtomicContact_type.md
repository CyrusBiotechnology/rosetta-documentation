XRW TO DO

```
<AtomicContact name="(string)" distance="(real; 4.0)" range1="(string)"
        residue2="(refpose_enabled_residue_number)" sidechain="(bool)"
        backbone="(bool)" protons="(bool)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **distance**: Distance below which a contact counts
-   **range1**: Space-separated pair of integers indicating the first residue range over which to evaluate the filter
-   **residue2**: Residue number that may be making atomic contacts with the range of residues range1
-   **sidechain**: Count sidechain contacts
-   **backbone**: Count contacts to the backbone
-   **protons**: Count contacts made by protons
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
