Not documented.  Appears to be some sort of relax analogue.  Related to BackboneTorsionSampler

```xml
<BackboneTorsionPerturbation name="(&string;)" start_res="(&positive_integer;)"
        stop_res="(&positive_integer;)" native="(&string;)"
        increase_cycles="(&real;)" recover_low="(&bool;)" temp="(&real;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"

        snapshot_interval="(100 &positive_integer;)" />
```

-   **start_res**: nominally lower bound for a region to sample, but it looks like it's ignored in the code. effectively defaults to 1
-   **stop_res**: nominally upper bound for a region to sample, but it looks like it's ignored in the code. effectively defaults to the size of the Pose at parse_my_tag time
-   **native**: file path to native pose, used to calculate gdtmm
-   **increase_cycles**: multiply cycle count by this
-   **recover_low**: recover the lowest-energy structure seen in the Monte Carlo trajectory at the end?
-   **temp**: Monte Carlo temperature
-   **scorefxn**: use this scorefunction (from the SCOREFXN section)
-   **task_operations**: A comma separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **dump_snapshots**: dump structures during sampling, Note that dump_snapshots must be set to make snapshot_prefix or snapshot_interval active
-   **snapshot_prefix**: prefix for structures dumped during sampling, Note that dump_snapshots must be set to make snapshot_prefix or snapshot_interval active
-   **snapshot_interval**: how frequently to dump structures during sampling, Note that dump_snapshots must be set to make snapshot_prefix or snapshot_interval active
