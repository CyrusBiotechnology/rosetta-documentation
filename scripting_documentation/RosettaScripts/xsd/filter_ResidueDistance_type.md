Returns true if the distance between 2 residues does not exceed the threshold

```
<ResidueDistance name="(string)" distance="(real)" res1_pdb_num="(residue_number)" res1_res_num="(non_negative_integer)" res2_pdb_num="(residue_number)" res2_res_num="(non_negative_integer)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   distance: Maximal distance between residue 1 and residue 2
-   res1_pdb_num: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   res1_res_num: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   res2_pdb_num: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   res2_res_num: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
