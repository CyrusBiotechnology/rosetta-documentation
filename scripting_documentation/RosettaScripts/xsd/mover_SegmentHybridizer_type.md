SegmentHybridize takes the principle from the cartesian hybridize protocol to close loops. it will align fragments to the broken section until the ends are close enough (as defined through rms_frags) to use the cartesian minimizer for closure. The principle is to allow small breaks to close one big gap, with the idea of closing the small ones through minimization. Can be used for loop closure or grafting (still very experimental).

-   fa_scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   frag_big: what fragment size should be used to close the gaps?
-   frag_smal: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   nfrags: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   cartfrag_overlap: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   use_seq: how to pick the fragments, as in either only secondary structure dependent or secondary structure and sequence dependent
-   rms_frags: at what size of a break to use the cartesian minimizer to close the gap
-   auto_mm: should the movemap (defines what should be allowed to minimize) be set automatically?
-   frag_tries: how many fragments should be tried?
-   mc_cycles: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   temp: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   use_frags: XSD XRW: TO DO

For subtag Span: 

-   begin: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   end: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   extend_outside: how far to go outside of the loop to allow fragement hybridization for loop closure (note, if you go too far out it might not close the loop...)
-   extend_inside: XSD XRW: TO DO
