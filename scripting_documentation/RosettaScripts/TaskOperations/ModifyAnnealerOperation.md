## ModifyAnnealer

Allows modification of the temperatures and quench used by the annealer during packing.

```
<ModifyAnnealer name=(&string) high_temp=(100.0 &Real) low_temp=(0.3 &Real) disallow_quench=(0 &bool)/>
```

-   high\_temp - the starting high temperature for the annealer
-   low\_temp - the temperature that the annealer cools to
-   disallow\_quench - quench accepts every change that lowers the energy. If you want more diversity it could be prudent to disallow the quench step. Quench is on by default.
