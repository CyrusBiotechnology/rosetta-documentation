Given a symmetry definition file that describes configuration and scoring of a symmetric system, this mover 'symmetrizes' an asymmetric pose.

```xml
<SetupForSymmetry name="(&string;)" definition="(&string;)"
        preserve_datacache="(0 &bool;)" symmetry_resource="(&string;)" />
```

-   **definition**: The path and filename for a symmetry definition file. This is optional because you can also specify -symmetry:symmetry_definition {pathto/filename_symmetry_definition_file} on the command line.
-   **preserve_datacache**: If true, the datacache from the input asymmetric pose will be copied into the new symmetric pose. If false, the pose datacache will be cleared. Default is false for historical reasons.
-   **symmetry_resource**: The name for symmetry definition object created by the ResourceManager; this Resource must be declared in the RESOURCES block at the top of the protocol XML file
