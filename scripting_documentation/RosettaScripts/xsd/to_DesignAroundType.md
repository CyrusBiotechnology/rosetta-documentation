XRW TO DO

```
<DesignAround name="(string)" resnums="(string)" design_shell="(real; 8.0)" allow_design="(bool; true)" resnums_allow_design="(bool; true)" repack_shell="(real; 8.0)" />
```

-   resnums: can be a list of pdb numbers, such as 291B,101A.
-   design_shell: what sphere to design around the target residues. Must be at least as large as design_shell.
-   allow_design: allow design in the sphere, else restrict to repacking.
-   resnums_allow_design: allow design in the resnums list, else restrict to repacking.
-   repack_shell: what sphere to pack around the target residues. Must be at least as large as design_shell.
