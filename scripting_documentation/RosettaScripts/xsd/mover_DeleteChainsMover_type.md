remove chains from a pose

```xml
<DeleteChainsMover name="(&string;)" chains="(&string;)" detect_bonds="(&bool;)"
        detect_pseudobonds="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **chains**: (REQUIRED) delete these chains.  The format appears to be unseparated chain letters, like 'AHLR'
-   **detect_bonds**: detect and delete broken bonds afterwards
-   **detect_pseudobonds**: detect and delete broken pseudobonds afterwards
