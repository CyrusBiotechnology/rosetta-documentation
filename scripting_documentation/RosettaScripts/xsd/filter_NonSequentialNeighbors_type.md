Filters based upon the number of neighboring residues in a non-sequential fashion.

```
<NonSequentialNeighbors name="(string)" distance_threshold="(real; 8.0)" neighbor_cutoff="(non_negative_integer; 10)" bound="(bool; false)" resnum="(non_negative_integer; 0)" jump="(non_negative_integer; 1)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   distance_threshold: distance from given residue from which to count the number of neighbors
-   neighbor_cutoff: number of neighboring residues that defines the cutoff
-   bound: is the protein bound or not?
-   resnum: The number indicating the residue of interest. If set to 0, the entire protein will be anlayzed.
-   jump: jump number
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
