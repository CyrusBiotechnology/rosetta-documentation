Does a file exist on disk? Useful to see whether we're recovering from a checkpoint

```
<FileExist name="(string)" filename="(string)" ignore_zero_byte="(bool; false)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   filename: what filename to test?
-   ignore_zero_byte: if true, files that are merely place holders (contain nothing) are treated as nonexistant (filter returns false).
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
