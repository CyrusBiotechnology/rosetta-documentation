How many residues are within an interaction distance of target_residue across the interface.

```
<ResidueBurial name="(string)" pdb_num="(string; XRW TO DO)" distance="(real; 8.0)" neighbors="(non_negative_integer; 1)" residue_fraction_buried="(real; 0.001)" task_operations="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   pdb_num: PDB identifier of residue of interest
-   distance: Distance cutoff
-   neighbors: When used with neighbors=1 this degenerates to just checking whether or not a residue is at the interface.
-   residue_fraction_buried: what fraction of the total residues defined as designable by the taskfactory should actually be buried in order to return false. The default (0.0001) effectively means that 1 suffices. Set to 1.0 if you want all residues to be buried.
-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
