What is the average degree connectivity of a subset of residues? Found to be useful for discriminating non-interacting designs from natural complexes.

```
<AverageDegree name="(string)" task_operations="(string)" threshold="(real; 0)"
        distance_threshold="(real; 8.0)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **threshold**: Lower limit below which the filter fails
-   **distance_threshold**: Count neighbors for residues closer than this distance
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
