Computes the energy of a particular score type for the entire pose and if that energy is lower than threshold, returns true. If no score_type is set, it filters on the entire scorefxn.

```
<ScoreType name="(string)"score_type="(string; total_score)"threshold="(real)"
        scorefxn="(string)"confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **score_type**: If no score_type is set, it filters on the entire scorefxn.
-   **threshold**: If that energy is lower than threshold, returns true.
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
