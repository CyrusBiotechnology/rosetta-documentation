XRW TO DO

```xml
<BundleReporter name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        score_type="(total_score &string;)" behavior="(ALWAYS_TRUE &behav;)"
        threshold="(0.0 &real;)" report_sequence="(0 &bool;)"
        use_three_letter_code="(0 &bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **score_type**: Score type on which to filter
-   **behavior**: Filter behavior
-   **threshold**: Threshold above which the filter may fail (do not need or want to specify if filter behavior is ALWAYS_TRUE or ALWAYS_FALSE)
-   **report_sequence**: Report the bundle sequence
-   **use_three_letter_code**: In reporting the bundle sequence, use three letter codes (may be desirable in case of noncanonical amino acids, in particular, where using the AA or one letter code would be a poor choice).
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
