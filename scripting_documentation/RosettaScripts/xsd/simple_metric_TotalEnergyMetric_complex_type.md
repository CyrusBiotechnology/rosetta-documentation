A metric to report the total energy of the system or the delta total energy between another input pose or the cmd-line set native.

```xml
<TotalEnergyMetric name="(&string;)" reference_name="(&string;)"
        use_native="(false &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use
-   **use_native**: Use the native as reference for DELTA score if present on the cmd-line.
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we calculate the total energy of only these residues.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
