This filter checks whether in the current configuration the scaffold is 'feeling' any of the hotspot stub constraints. This is useful for quick triaging of hopeless configuration. If used in conjunction with the Mover PlaceSimultaneously, don't bother setting flags -- the Mover will take care of it.
