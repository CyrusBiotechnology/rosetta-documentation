#Sidechain Design aided by Sewing
When backbones were generated by Sewing (AssemblyMover), native rotamers are saved with file name as xxx.rot (NativeRotamersFile).
Therefore, one can give some bonus to these native residue types (add ResidueType constraints to pose) when designing sidechains (using [[AssemblyConstraintsMover]]).
