######Comments on Revisions
It is now possible to add comments on any acknowledged revision. 
To add a comment, simply login with your github account and type your comment text. 
While posting you can also select 'notify the list' check box if you want notification of this comment to be sent not only to the author of revision and people who have already commented on this particular revision but to the mailing list associated with this branch (rosetta-log list in case of master branch). 
You can also delete your existing comments (you need to be logged in) by pressing the X button on top-right of your comment. 

Comments are an excellent way to pseudo-amend bad commit messages!
Our GitHub repositories only accumulate history and do not allow rewriting of history, so if you pushed some revision with a wrong/empty/merge commit message there is no way to undo this action. 
Instead, use the comment feature to supply additional information for future records, or just communicate with the other developers:
