-   **generations**: Number of generations for the genetic algorithm to evolve
-   **pop_size**: number of sequences per generation
-   **num_packs**: number of times to call the simulated annealer to find the best rotamer configuration for a given sequence
-   **pop_from_ss**: number of sequences to include in the initial population that are created by mutation of the sequence determined by full redesign
-   **numresults**: number of sequences to output structures for, starting with the lowest scoring sequence
-   **fraction_by_recombination**: fraction of sequences to generate by recombination of sequences from the previous generation
-   **mutate_rate**: probability of randomizing each residue when a sequence is mutated
-   **boltz_temp**: Temperature for Metropolis criterion
-   **anchor_offset**: Anchor offset for multistate packer aggregate function
-   **checkpoint_prefix**: prefix to add to the beginning of checkpoint file names
-   **checkpoint_interval**: frequency in number of sequences scored with which the checkpoint files are written
-   **checkpoint_gz**: compress the checkpoint files with gzip
-   **checkpoint_rename**: rename checkpoint files after the genetic algorithm completes, so that subsequent runs generate new output
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
