-   interface: Interface in jump numbering of interest; this numbering is sequential.
-   ch1: Interested in loops from 'chain 1' of the jump?
-   ch2: Interested in loops from 'chain 2' of the jump?
-   min_length: Minimum loop length of interest
-   max_length: Maximum loop length of interest
-   interface_cutoff: Distance over which to consider the 'interface' between chains
-   mingap: How far away from other loops must new loops be?
-   resnum: Residue number to define distance cutoff; use this or pdb_num
-   pdb_num: Residue number to define distance cutoff; use this or resnum
-   CA_CA_distance: Distance cutoff from user-defined residue
