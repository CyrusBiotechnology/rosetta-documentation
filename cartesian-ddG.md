#cartesian\_ddg application

Metadata
========
The documentation was last updated November 2nd, 2016, by Hahnbeom Park. Questions about this documentation should be directed to Frank DiMaio: dimaio(@u.washington.edu). The documentation is only for monomeric ddg calculation for now.

Reference
==========

The algorithm and benchmark result on monomeric ddg dataset (Kellogg et al) was published in:

Hahnbeom Park, Philip Bradley, Per Greisen Jr., Yuan Liu, Vikram Khipple Mulligan, David E Kim, David Baker, and Frank DiMaio (2016) "Simultaneous optimization of biomolecular energy function on features from small molecules and macromolecules", JCTC. 

Command Line Options
====================
First, input pdb should be properly relaxed in cartesian space with restrained backbone and sidechain coordinates. Please refer to [[here|relax]] for more information. 

An example of command line is:
```
cartesian\_ddg.linuxgccrelease 
 -database $ROSETTADB
 -s [inputpdb] 
 â€“ddg:mut\_file [mutfile]: same syntax with what being used in ddg-monomer application; see [[here | ddg-monomer]].
 -ddg:iterations 3: can be flexible; 3 is fast and reasonable
 -ddg::cartesian 
 -ddg::dump\_pdbs false 
 -bbnbr 1
 -fa\_max\_dis 9.0
 -[scorefunction option]: any other options for score function containing cart_bonded term, for example, -beta\_cart or -score:weights talaris2014\_cart]
```

Expected Outputs & post-processing
===============
Running application will produce a file named [pdbfile_prefix]\_[mutationindex].ddg; for example 1ctf\_G44S.ddg. 

The file contains lines:
BEFORE_JUMP: RoundX: [WT or MUT\_XXXX]: [totalscore] fa_atr: [fa\_atr] .....

In the paper, the difference in totalscores averaged over 3 rounds for WT and MUT is taken as ddG:

ddG = avrg(MUT totalscore) - avrg(WT totalscore)
