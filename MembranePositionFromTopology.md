## Description

This Mover only applies to a fixed protein and movable membrane (i.e. one of the protein residues is at the root of the FoldTree). It uses knowledge of the trans-membrane spans (stored in the SpanningTopology object) and CÎ± coordinates to compute the centers and normals of each transmembrane span (i.e. EmbeddingDef objects), computes an average, and sets the membrane center and normal to these values. It should be noted that this mover does not continuously optimize the membrane center and normal using a minimization scheme, but rather provides a first estimation that can be subsequently refined (for instance using membrane relax or the MembraneRelaxMover).
