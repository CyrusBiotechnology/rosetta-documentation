Main AntibodyDesignProtocol, tieing together individual movers and classes. Main mover for application.

```

-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **atom_pair_cst_weight**: Weight for atom pair constraints to use in the global antibody design score function
-   **dihedral_cst_weight**: Weight for atom pair constraints to use in the global antibody design score function
-   **global_atom_pair_cst_scoring**: Score atom pair constraints to use in the global antibody design score function?
-   **global_dihedral_cst_scoring**: Score dihedral constraints to use in the global antibody design score function?
-   **min_scorefxn**: Name of score function to use for minimization
-   **seq_design_cdrs**: CDR regions to be Sequence-Designed
-   **graft_design_cdrs**: CDR regions to be Graft-Designed
-   **primary_cdrs**: Manually set the CDRs which can be chosen in the outer cycle. 
These should be on for either Sequence-Design or Graft-Design. 
Normally, the outer cycles are whatever CDRs we are designing, including CDRs which are sequence-design only.  
Use this if you are primarily interested in specific CDRs (such as graft-designing H3 and allowing H1 and L3 to sequence design during the inner cycle.)
-   **instruction_file**: XSD XRW: TO DO
-   **instructions_file**: used if not instruction_file attribute specified
-   **cdr_instructions_file**: used if not instructions_file attribute specififed
-   **run_snugdock**: Run snugdock at the end
-   **run_relax**: Run relax at the end and after snugdock (optional)
-   **remove_antigen**: Removes antigen at the very beginning of the protocol
