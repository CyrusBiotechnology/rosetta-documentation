Keeps a specified region of the current pose and deletes the rest

```xml
<KeepRegionMover name="(&string;)" nter_overhang="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        cter_overhang="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        start_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)"
        start_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        end_pdb_num="(&residue_number;)" end_res_num="(&non_negative_integer;)" />
```

-   **nter_overhang**: Number of residues N terminal to start to include
-   **cter_overhang**: Number of residues C terminal to end to include
-   **start_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **start_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **end_pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **end_res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
