---
Filter for poses that place a neighbour of the types specified around a target residue in the partner protein.

```
<NeighborType pdb_num="(residue_number)" res_num="(non_negative_integer)"
        distance="(real; 8.0)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" >
    <Neighbors type="(string)" />
</NeighborType>
```

-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **distance**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that this pose will be filtered out if the filter fails


Subtag **Neighbors**:   XRW TO DO

-   **type**: XRW TO DO
