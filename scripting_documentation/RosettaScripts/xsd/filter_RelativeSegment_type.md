---
Reports the numbers of residues that align with a segment on source pose.

```
<RelativeSegment name="(string)"source_pose="(string)"
        start_res="(non_negative_integer)"end_res="(non_negative_integer)"
        confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **source_pose**: PDB file storing the pose to which to align. The two poses should be superimposed prior to running. This filter will not superimpose.
-   **start_res**: Starting residue for alignment. Rosetta numbering only
-   **end_res**: Ending residue for alignment. Rosetta numbering only
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
