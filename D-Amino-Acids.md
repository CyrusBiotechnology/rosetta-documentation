## What are D-amino acids?
D-alpha-amino acids are amino acids with inverted chirality at the alpha carbon relative to the conventional L-alpha-amino acids.  Conventionally, the mirror-image versions of the 19 canonical chiral amino acids are called by the same names (D-tyrosine is the mirror image of L-tyrosine, for example).

There are two special cases in which we have to be careful about definitions: the two canonical amino acids that also have a chiral center in the side-chain (L-threonine and L-isoleucine) have this chiral center reversed in their D-forms, as well, making D-threonine the true mirror image of L-threonine and D-isoleucine the true mirror image of L-isoleucine.  (Inversion of the side-chain alone produces L-_allo_-threonine and L-_allo-isoleucine, while inversion of the backbone chiral center alone produces D-_allo_-threonine and D-_allo_-isoleucine.)
