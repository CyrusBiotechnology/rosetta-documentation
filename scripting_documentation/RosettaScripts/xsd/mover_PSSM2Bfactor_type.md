Sets B factors in the PDB based on per-residue PSSM score

```
<PSSM2Bfactor name="(string)" Value_for_blue="(real; 5.0)"
        chain_num="(non_negative_integer; 1)" Value_for_red="(real; -1.0)" />
```

-   **Value_for_blue**: PSSM score cutoff below which b factors will
-   **chain_num**: Chain number for which to calculate PSSM and store as B factors
-   **Value_for_red**: Above this PSSM score, B factors will be set to 50
