A metric for counting the number of residues in a pose or residue selection, and adding the count to the resulting score file.

```xml
<SelectedResidueCountMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **residue_selector**: A residue selector.  The number of residues selected by this selector will be returned as the count.  If not provided, the number of residues in the pose will be returned.
