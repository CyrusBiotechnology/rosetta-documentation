Computes the difference in a filter's value compared to the input structure

```
<Delta name="(string)" range="(real; 0.0)" lower="(bool; false)"
        upper="(bool; true)" filter="(string)" relax_mover="(string; null)"
        unbound="(bool; false)" relax_unbound="(bool; false)"
        changing_baseline="(bool; false)" scorefxn="(string)"
        jump="(non_negative_integer; 1)" reference_name="(string)"
        reference_pdb="(string; XRW TO DO)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **range**: how much above/below the baseline to allow?
-   **lower**: the threshold is upper/lower? Use both if the threshold is an exact value.
-   **upper**: the threshold is upper/lower? Use both if the threshold is an exact value.
-   **filter**: the name of a predefined filter for evaluation.
-   **relax_mover**: called at parse-time before setting the baseline.
-   **unbound**: translates the partners by 10000A before evaluating the baseline and the filters. Allows evaluation of the unbound pose.
-   **relax_unbound**: relax the unbound state w/ relax mover?
-   **changing_baseline**: reset baseline value to current value after every accept
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **jump**: if unbound is set, this can be used to set the jump along which to translate.
-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **reference_pdb**: use reference pose from disk
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
