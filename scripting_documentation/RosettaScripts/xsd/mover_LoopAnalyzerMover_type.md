This mover reports scores and statistics useful for judging the quality of loops

```
<LoopAnalyzerMover name="(string)" use_tracer="(bool; false)" loops_file="(string)" >
    <Loop start="(non_negative_integer)" stop="(non_negative_integer)" cut="(non_negative_integer; 0)" skip_rate="(real; 0.0)" rebuild="(bool; false)" />
</LoopAnalyzerMover>
```

-   use_tracer: report output to a Tracer
-   loops_file: path to loops file


For subtag Loop: Use this element to define a series of loops in subtags, one loop per subtag

-   start: The residue index (pose numbering) for the first position in the loop.
-   stop: The residue index (pose numbering) for the last position in the loop.
-   cut: The residue index (pose numbering) for the cutpoint residue (i.e. the cut residue will be the lower end of the chain break, and the cut+1 residue will be the upper end of the chain break). If a zero value is given, it will be interpretted as saying that the cutpoint should be chosen using the logic in protocols::loops::Loop::choose_cutpoint
-   skip_rate: The probability that you would like the loop will be skipped (such as by the IndependentLoopMover); a value less than zero means never skip, a value greater than one means always skip - NOT RESPECTED BY ALL PROTOCOLS
-   rebuild: If set to true, then the initial backbone dihedrals for the loop will be overwritten to produce an extended conformation (i.e. phi=-150 degres, psi=150, omego=180) and the bond angles and lengths will be idealized - NOT RESPECTED BY AL PROTOCOLS
