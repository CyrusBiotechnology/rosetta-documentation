# CS-Rosetta

Chemical-Shift-Rosetta (CS-Rosetta) is a tool for protein structure prediction using chemical shifts.
In particular, it is able to take 13CA, 13CB, 13C', 15N, 1HA and 1HN NMR chemical shifts as input, using this data to select PDB fragments (with similar shifts) for Rosetta structure prediction.
More information on CS-Rosetta is available externally at [[http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/CSROSETTA/]] and [[http://csrosetta.chemistry.ucsc.edu/]].
