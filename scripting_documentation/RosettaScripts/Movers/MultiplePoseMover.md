## MultiplePoseMover

This mover allows a multi-step "distribute and collect" protocol to be implemented in a single script, for example ab initio followed by RMSD clustering, or docking followed by design.

See the [[MultiplePoseMover|RosettaScripts-MultiplePoseMover]] page for details and examples.
