##Sidechain Design aided by Sewing
When backbones were generated by Sewing (AssemblyMover), native rotamers are saved with file name as xxx.rot (NativeRotamersFile).
Therefore, one can give some bonus to these Sewing-derived-native-rotamers (add ResidueType constraints to pose) when designing sidechains (by AssemblyConstraintsMover).

For example,
```xml
<MOVERS>
   <AssemblyConstraintsMover name=ACM native_rotamers_file=(native rotamer file name like 'test_0001_from_25.rot') native_bonus=(preferred bonus value, like '1')/>
   <FastRelax name=fastrelax repeats=1 disable_design=false scorefxn=talaris_cart cartesian=1 task_operations=resfile,keep_curr,layerdesign delete_virtual_residues_after_FastRelax=1/>
</MOVERS>
<PROTOCOLS>
   <Add mover_name="ACM"/>
   <Add mover=fastrelax/>
</PROTOCOLS>
```
