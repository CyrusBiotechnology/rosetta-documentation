Set a list of cysteine pairs to form disulfides and repack their surroundings. Useful for cases where the disulfides aren't recognized by Rosetta.

```xml
<ForceDisulfides name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        disulfides="(&colon_sep_size_pair_cslist;)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **disulfides**: (REQUIRED) For instance: 23A:88A,22B:91B. Can also take regular Rosetta numbering as in: 24:88,23:91.
