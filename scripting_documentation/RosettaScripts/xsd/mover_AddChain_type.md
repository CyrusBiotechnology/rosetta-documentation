Replace or add chains to a pose from other PDBs

```
<AddChain name="(string)" random_access="(bool; false)" file_name="(string)" new_chain="(bool; true)" swap_chain_number="(non_negative_integer; 0)" scorefxn="(string)" />
```

-   random_access: if true randomly choose one file name from a list and work with that throughout the run.
-   file_name: Either a path to the file to read chains from, or a comma-separated list of such if random_access is true.
-   new_chain: There is some interaction between swap_chain_number and new_chain; probably you can use only one.  add as a new chain?
-   swap_chain_number: There is some interaction between swap_chain_number and new_chain; probably you can use only one.  swap chain with specified chain number
-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
