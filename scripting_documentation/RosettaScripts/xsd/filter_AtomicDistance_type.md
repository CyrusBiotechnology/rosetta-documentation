Filters on the distance between two specific atoms or the minimal distance between atoms of two specific types, on one or two residues.

```xml
<AtomicDistance name="(&string;)" distance="(4.0 &real;)"
        residue1="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)"
        residue2="(&refpose_enabled_residue_number;)" atomtype1="(&string;)"
        atomtype2="(&string;)" atomname1="(CB &string;)"
        atomname2="(CB &string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **distance**: Distance threshold between atoms in question
-   **residue1**: First residue
-   **residue2**: Second residue
-   **atomtype1**: Type desired for first atom
-   **atomtype2**: Type of second atom
-   **atomname1**: Name desired for first atom
-   **atomname2**: Name of second atom
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
