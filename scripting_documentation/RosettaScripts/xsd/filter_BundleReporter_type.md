<BundleReporter name="(string)" scorefxn="(string)" score_type="(string; total_score)" behavior="(behav; ALWAYS_TRUE)" threshold="(real; 0.0)" report_sequence="(bool; 0)" use_three_letter_code="(bool; 0)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   score_type: Score type on which to filter
-   behavior: Filter behavior
-   threshold: Threshold above which the filter may fail (do not need or want to specify if filter behavior is ALWAYS_TRUE or ALWAYS_FALSE)
-   report_sequence: Report the bundle sequence
-   use_three_letter_code: In reporting the bundle sequence, use three letter codes (may be desirable in case of noncanonical amino acids, in particular, where using the AA or one letter code would be a poor choice).
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
