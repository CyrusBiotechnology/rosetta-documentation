A version of the AverageDegree filter that is compatible with oligomeric building blocks. Includes other subunits within the same building block in the neighbor count. Also works for monomeric building blocks.

```
<OligomericAverageDegree name="(string)" threshold="(non_negative_integer; 0)"
         distance_threshold="(real; 10.0)" jump="(integer; 1)" sym_dof_names="(string)"
         write2pdb="(bool; 0)" verbose="(bool; 0)" multicomp="(bool; 0)" task_operations="(string)"
         confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **threshold**: How many residues need to be on average in the sphere of each of the residues under scrutiny in order for the filter to return true.
-   **distance_threshold**: Size of sphere around each residue under scrutiny in Angstroms.
-   **jump**: Which jump separates the building block from others?
-   **sym_dof_names**: Which sym_dofs separate the building blocks from the others (must also set multicomp=1 if it is a multicomponent symmetric system)?
-   **write2pdb**: Whether to write the residue-level AverageDegree values to the output .pdb file.
-   **verbose**: Output jump and corresponding displacement or angle to tracer.
-   **multicomp**: Set to true if the systems has multiple components.
-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
