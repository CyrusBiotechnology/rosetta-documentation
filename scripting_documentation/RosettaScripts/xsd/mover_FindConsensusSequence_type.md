Takes in multiple poses from the MSDJobDistributor and finds theconsensus sequence that optimizes energy of all input poses

```
<FindConsensusSequence name="(string)" scorefxn="(string)" task_operations="(string)"
         resfiles="(string)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: Score function to use when evaluating best amino acids at each position
-   **task_operations**: Specifies behavior of the packer when substituting different amino acids and repacking.
-   **resfiles**: A list of resfiles to define designable and repackable residuesfor all states in multistate design. Multiple resfiles can be usedfor multiple states - in this case the first resfile in the tagwill be applied to the first structure, etc.One single resfile used for all states is also supported.
