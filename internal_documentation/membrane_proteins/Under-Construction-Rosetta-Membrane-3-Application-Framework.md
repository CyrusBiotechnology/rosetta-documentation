## Background
Rosetta was originally designed for use with proteins in solution. However, the importance of membrane proteins to drug development and understanding disease highlights the need for new structure determination and refinement tools.  The **RosettaMembrane Framework** provides a generalized toolkit for modeling membrane proteins in Rosetta. The framework implements a core representation of a membrane protein in the conformation, kinematic, and energy layers. These representations can be easily accessed at the protocols level through the mover interface. 

The membrane framework is implemented in C++, but is also compatible with the Resource Manager, PyRosetta, and RosettaScripts Interfaces.

This is the homepage for developer-level membrane framework documentation. Please contact the authors listed above with any questions.
