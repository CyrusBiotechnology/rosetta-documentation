-   **jump_number**: Jump, numbered sequentially from 1, that defines the interface
-   **cutoff**: Upper threshold beyond which the filter fails
-   **generous_hbonds**: Use a generous definition of H-bonds
-   **sasa_burial_cutoff**: Use a SASA threshold to define residue burial
-   **AHD_cutoff**: Cutoff for AHD angle, in degrees, to define a hydrogen bond
-   **dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond
-   **hxl_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a hydroxyl
-   **sulph_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a sulfur
-   **metal_dist_cutoff**: Cutoff for distance, in Angstroms, to define a hydrogen bond to a metal
-   **scorefxn**: commandline
-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
