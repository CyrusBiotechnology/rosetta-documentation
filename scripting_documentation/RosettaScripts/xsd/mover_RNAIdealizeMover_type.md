Idealize a pose, moving its bond lengths and angles towards ideal values by repeated relaxation

```
<RNAIdealizeMover name="(string)"iterations="(positive_integer)"noise="(bool)"
        final_minimize="(bool)" />
```

-   **iterations**: Number of iterations over which to spread idealization
-   **noise**: Salt initial pose with some Gaussian noise
-   **final_minimize**: Minimize the whole pose at once at the end
