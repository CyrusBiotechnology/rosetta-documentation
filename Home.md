## What is Rosetta??
Rosetta is a comprehensive software suite for modeling macromolecular structures. As a flexible, multi-purpose application, it includes tools for structure prediction, design, and remodeling of proteins and nucleic acids. Since 1998, Rosetta web servers have run billions of structure prediction and protein design simulations.

Researchers use Rosetta to better understand treatments of infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune disorders. Further applications involve the development of vaccines, new materials, targeted protein binders, and enzyme design.

Rosetta began as a structure prediction tool, and has consistently been a strong performer in the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) community-wide blind prediction exercises. It has grown to offer a wide variety of effective sampling algorithms to explore backbone, side-chain and sequence space, and its excellence has generalized to more community-wide exercises including RNA-puzzles and Critical Assessment of PRotein Interactions. Rosetta boasts broadly tested scoring (energy) functions and contains an unparalleled breadth of applications from folding to docking to design.

Rosetta is freely available to academic and government laboratories, with over 10,000 free licenses already in use. An active support forum allows users to easily collaborate within the broad research community of Rosetta users.

##Documentation

Rosetta is distributed as source, and thus will require being [[compiled and installed|Build-Documentation]] before use. Before using Rosetta, you should familiarize yourself with the [[basic rosetta concepts|Rosetta Basics]] used throughout our applications. A compiled version of Rosetta contains a large variety of pre-made [[applications|Application-Documentation]] that were designed and created for specific modeling or design tasks. For most users, these applications will be all you need. However, advanced users may find themselves wanting new applications that better suit their specific needs. In this case, please read our guides for [[developing Rosetta code|Development-Documentation]].
