Calculate either a correlation (match_res true) or zscore related to the fit to the density.  Uses internal density tools to do so.  Numbers and cutoffs match well with Coot's density fit analysis tool. Zscore uses weighted sum of density, density-compared-to-neighbors, rama (where applicable) and cart_bonded to compute)  Correlation is same values used to calculate density scores.  Zscore reference is here: eLife 2016, Dimaio

```xml
<PerResidueDensityFitMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        output_as_pdb_nums="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)"
        sliding_window_size="(3 &positive_integer;)" match_res="(false &bool;)"
        mixed_sliding_window="(false &bool;)" use_native="(false &bool;)"
        use_selector_as_zscore_mask="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **output_as_pdb_nums**: If outputting to scorefile use PDB numbering instead of Rosetta (default)
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we only calculate and output metrics for the subset of residues selected.
-   **sliding_window_size**: Sliding window size for density calculation
-   **match_res**: Use density correlation instead of a zscore to fit to density
-   **mixed_sliding_window**: Use a window size of 3 for protein and 1 for glycans.  May skew results.
-   **use_native**: Use a native set with in:file:native to do the selection for benchmarking purposes.
-   **use_selector_as_zscore_mask**: Use the selector as true mask to calculate the Zscore.  Otherwise, use it just as a selection for computation.  Default true.
