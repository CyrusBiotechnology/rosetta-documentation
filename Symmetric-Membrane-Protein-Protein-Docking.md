## About
Membrane proteins often assemble into symmetric complexes in the membrane environment. While the exact reason for internal symmetry is stil debated, it has been suggested that symmetry enhances proteins stability and avoid traps in the energy landscape during conformational changes needed for function. The symmetric membrane protein-protein docking application combines the symmetry machinery, membrane framework, and symmetric docking applciation to assemble symmetric complexes in the membrane. 

## Algorithm Description
The application first constructs a symmetric membrane protein conformation from an asymmetric unit by placing a membrane virtual at the origin of the coordinate frame and arranging subunits around the membrane normal axis (cyclic symmetry). The symmetric docking application is then used to apply symmetric moves, packing operations, and iterations of scoring using the membrane all atom energy function to sample possible conformations. The ensemble of output models describe possible conformations of this complex in the membrane environment. 

This application currently supports modeling of cyclic symmetries. 

## Code and Demo
The membrane ddG application is implemented as a python script in PyRosetta. An example script lives in the Rosetta/demos/protocol_captures/2014/mpframework-ddG directory called compute_ompLA_ddG.py

## Example Command Lines
Membrane Symmetric Protein-Protein Docking is a C++ application in the Rosetta 3 software suite. 

Application: membrane_symmdocking.<platform-exe> 

# Generating input files
## Generating Inputs
The symmetric membrane protein-protein docking application requires two input files: 

1. Generating a Spanfile
A spanfile describing transmembrane spanning regions can be generated using the OCTOPUS server (http://octopus.cbr.su.se/). This file must be converted to a Rosetta spanfile format using the
octopus2span.pl script. Use the following command: 

```
cd mpframework-symdock/scripts/
./octopus2span.pl octopus_pred.out > spanfile.txt
```

2. Generate a Symmetry definition file
Symmetry definition files describe the symmetry of the system and serve as instructions to Rosetta for building the full starting complex from an asymmetric unit. This file can be generated using the make_symmdef_file.pl script in src/apps/public/symmetry/. Detailed information for generation of symmetry definition files can be found at https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/make-symmdef-file.html. In general, this script requires a PDB file, symmetry mode (NCS or PSEUDO only for membranes), specification of the asymmetric unit and symmetry group # if known. 

The symmetry definition file in this example was generated with the following commandline. 

```
./make_symmdef_file.pl -m NCS -p 1afo.pdb -r 10.0 -a A -b B:2 
```

Symmetries can also be generated using a denovo protocol. If the user knows the symmetry group (e.g. C3), 
the user can generate a definition for this symmetry group independent of the structure. This script can 
be found in src/apps/public/symmetry/make_symmdef_denovo.py. More information for using this script can 
be found here: https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/make-symmdef-file-denovo.html
