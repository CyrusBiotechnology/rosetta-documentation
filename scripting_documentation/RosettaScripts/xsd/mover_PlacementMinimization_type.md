A simple rb-minimization in a bb-stub constraint biased forcefield. Note that this mover is dependent on a placement mover for setting its stubsets

```
<PlacementMinimization name="(string)" host_chain="(positive_integer; 2)"
        cb_force="(real; 0.5)" optimize_foldtree="(bool; false)"
        minimize_rb="(bool; true)" >
    <StubSets >
        <Add stubfile="(string)" />
    </StubSets>
</PlacementMinimization>
```

-   **host_chain**: Probably the chain where the stub goes
-   **cb_force**: Force to apply to CB atoms.  Must be positive.
-   **optimize_foldtree**: setup new fold_tree for better numerical behaviour between the residue at the center of target_residues and the nearest residue on the partner
-   **minimize_rb**: minimize the rigid body degree of freedom


Subtag **StubSets**:   A container for tags that indicate stubfiles to be loaded



Subtag **Add**:   

-   **stubfile**: File that has stubs in it
