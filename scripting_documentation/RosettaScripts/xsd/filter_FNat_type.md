Filter for poor values of Fnat, a docking metric

```
<FNat name="(string)"reference_name="(string)"threshold="(real; 5)"
        jump="(non_negative_integer; 1)"scorefxn="(string)"
        confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **threshold**: Threshold for Fnat, a docking metric above which the filter fails
-   **jump**: Jump across which the computation is carried out, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
