---
Allows modification of the temperatures and quench used by the annealer during packing.

```
<ModifyAnnealer name="(string)"disallow_quench="(bool; false)"
        high_temp="(real; 100.0)"low_temp="(real; 0.3)" />
```

-   **disallow_quench**: quench accepts every change that lowers the energy. If you want more diversity it could be prudent to disallow the quench step. Quench is on by default.
-   **high_temp**: the starting high temperature for the annealer
-   **low_temp**: the temperature that the annealer cools to
