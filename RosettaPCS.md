Thomas Huber might still be using this code. Christophe developed several software tools involving Pseudo-Contact-Shifts and paramagnetic NMR as part of his PhD: [http://www.nmr.chem.uu.nl/~christophe/](http://www.nmr.chem.uu.nl/~christophe/)

# Summary
The purpose of this application is to fold proteins with the help of Pseudo-Contact-Shift (PCS) NMR restraints only (additional use of restraints has not been tested (at least not by me - JKL)). Since PCSs are a paramagnetic effect, they are measured as chemical shift perturbations of a paramagnetically labelled protein with respect to a diamagnetic reference protein. For correct aquisition of the diamagnetic chemical shifts, the protein in the sample should still be labelled, but with a diamagnetic reference. Also, MTSL, even though paramagnetic, will not lead to PCS, since their
