This mover is useful for reporting the total or per-residue ddgs in cases where you don't want to use the ddG filter for some reason. (also, the ddg filter can't currently do per-residue ddgs). Ddg scores are reported as string-real pairs in the job. The total ddg score has the tag "ddg" and the each per residue ddg has the tag "residue_ddg_n" where n is the residue number.

```xml
<ddG name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"
        per_residue_ddg="(false &bool;)" repack_unbound="(false &bool;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        repack_bound="(true &bool;)" relax_bound="(false &bool;)"
        translate_by="(1000 &real;)" relax_mover="(&string;)"
        filter="(&string;)" chain_num="(&string;)" chain_name="(&string;)" />
```
