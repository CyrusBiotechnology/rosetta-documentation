Replace or add chains to a pose from other PDBs

```xml
<AddChain name="(&string;)" random_access="(false &bool;)"
        file_name="(&string;)" new_chain="(true &bool;)"
        swap_chain_number="(0 &non_negative_integer;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **random_access**: if true randomly choose one file name from a list and work with that throughout the run.
-   **file_name**: (REQUIRED) Either a path to the file to read chains from, or a comma-separated list of such if random_access is true.
-   **new_chain**: There is some interaction between swap_chain_number and new_chain; probably you can use only one.  add as a new chain?
-   **swap_chain_number**: There is some interaction between swap_chain_number and new_chain; probably you can use only one.  swap chain with specified chain number
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
