Solving a Biological Problem
=============

There are many biological problems of interest, often stemming from the central idea that sequence confers structure which in turn confers function.
Rosetta is a macromolecular modeling software capable of tackling some of these problems.
Common problems which are in the realm of Rosetta are listed below.

## Protein Structure Prediction

Note: put fold and dock in here as well as symmetry.

Given a sequence, can I predict the protein structure?
There are two general approaches to predicting protein structure: _de novo_ and comparative or homology modeling.


### De Novo Modeling

Rosetta was initially created with _de novo_ protein structure prediction in mind.
_De novo_ structure prediction is useful when modeling a protein with low homology. 
_De novo_ structure prediction is accurate when modeling a small (<100 residues), globular protein.

### Comparative Modeling (Homology Modeling)

Comparative modeling on the other hand tends to be successful when the target sequence (sequence of interest) has a high degree of sequence homology (>50%) with a protein whose structure has been determined.
