Filters structures based on the total number of residues in the structure.

```xml
<ResidueCount name="(&string;)" max_residue_count="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        min_residue_count="(&non_negative_integer;)"
        count_as_percentage="(false &bool;)" residue_types="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" packable="(false &bool;)"
        confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **max_residue_count**: Is the total number of residues less than or equal to the maximum allowable residue count?
-   **min_residue_count**: Is the total number of residues more than or equal to the minimum allowable residue count?
-   **count_as_percentage**: If this is true, count residues as percentage (=100*raw_number_of_specified_residue/total_residue) instead of counting raw number of it, also max_residue_count/min_residue_count are assumed to be entered as percentage
-   **residue_types**: Comma-separated list of which residue type names. (e.g. "CYS,SER,HIS_D" ). Only residues with type names matching those in the list will be counted.
-   **task_operations**: A comma separated list of TaskOperations to use.
-   **residue_selector**: Restrict counting to a set of residues
-   **packable**: ? This parameter seems to do nothing at all ?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
