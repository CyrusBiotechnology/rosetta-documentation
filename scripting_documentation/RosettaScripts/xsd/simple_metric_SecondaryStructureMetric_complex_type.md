A metric getting the Secondary Structure string of a pose or subset of residues via residue selector using DSSP

```xml
<SecondaryStructureMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        dssp_reduced="(true &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **dssp_reduced**: Use the reduced DSSP alphabet (3 letters)
-   **residue_selector**: Use a residue selector to output the secondary structure of only residues in selection.
