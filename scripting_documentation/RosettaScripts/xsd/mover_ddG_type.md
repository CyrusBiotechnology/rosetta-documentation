This mover is useful for reporting the total or per-residue ddgs in cases where you don't want to use the ddG filter for some reason. (also, the ddg filter can't currently do per-residue ddgs). Ddg scores are reported as string-real pairs in the job. The total ddg score has the tag "ddg" and the each per residue ddg has the tag "residue_ddg_n" where n is the residue number.

```
<ddG name="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)"

        relax_bound="(false &bool;)" translate_by="(1000 &real;)"

        chain_name="(&string;)" />
