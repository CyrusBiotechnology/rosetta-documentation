This mover will use only motif pairs found in input motif_sets or in the default motif sets to design interface residues.

```
<SchemePlaceMotifs name="(string)" dumpfile="(string; XRW TO DO)" mode="(string; basic)" allowed_aas="(string; motifs)" halt_on_error="(bool; false)" motif_sets="(string; XRW TO DO)" scorefxn="(string)" task_operations="(string)" />
```

-   dumpfile: This is an option to generate a extra pdb that dumps the motifs used for packing, it's meant for troubleshooting.
-   mode: The option 'standard' will just skip the mode setting. 'standard' is the recommended use, it requires taskops and then looks for motifs in the designable residues. 'basic' uses Will's scheme logic to decide where the motifs are being placed (and therefore which residues are designable).
-   allowed_aas: This means that it will use the motifs in the motif files. Do not change this, there is currently no other option.
-   halt_on_error: XRW TO DO: unsure?
-   motif_sets: Path to motif sets file to use.
-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
