* AssemblyScore: ClashScore + InterModelMotifScore + InterfaceMotif (0 for monomer) + MotifScore

* atom: A collection of xyz coordinates and element

* cycle (during assembly of models): “cycle iteration” requires a monte carlo accept (not just a trial). For example, if the cycle # is set to 50,000, the actual number of trials of model assembly would be even much larger than "cycle #".

* InterModelMotifScore: A type of MotifScore, but it is calculated only between non-adjacent models. Without consideration of this 'InterModelMotifScore', the "best" assembled model would be just linear helices etc. With this 'InterModelMotifScore' in mind, the "best" assembled model would be more globular-like.

* linker segments: When there are 5 secondary structures in each model, 3 middle secondary structures are "linker segments". 2 N-terminal/C-terminal secondary structures are not "linker segments".

* model (node/substructure): This can be connected by their edges through their nodes. For example, a smotif model has 2 nodes (N-term/C-term) and 3 secondary structures. A collection of segments. Generally, 2-5 pieces of segment constitute the model. Currently for continuous SEWING, 3 pieces of secondary structures called smotif (like HLH, or HLE) is a model (5 pieces of secondary structures as a model for continuous SEWING are in active development). Defined as struct whose elements are model_id, pdb_code, structure_id, distance, hoist_angle, packing_angle and meridian_angle. 

* MotifScore: Designability score. Basically it shows that how well hydrophobic parts of secondary structures are well packed with each other. Will Sheffler in Baker lab made this.

* node (model/substructure): Single secondary structure. Not all nodes can be merged with other node through their edge. For example, a smotif model has 3 nodes (secondary structures), but only two of them (N-term/C-term) can be merged with other nodes. 5-ss based model has 5 nodes (secondary structures), but only two of them (N-term/C-term) can be merged with other nodes.

* PartnerMotifScore:  A type of MotifScore, but it will not be calculated in monomer design

* residue: composition (seq_pos, residue_type, chi angles)

* secondary structures: H, L, E

* segment: composition (segment_number, secondary_structure, linkage_Boolean_to_other_segment_for_model_build), original definition (A collection of secondary structures), practical definition (As of now just 1 secondary structure equals 1 segment)

* sewing_hasher: Four modes are possible
``` 
generate: generates a model file from a sqlite database
generate_five_ss_model: generates a model file that is consisted with 3~5 secondary structures from a sqlite database
hash: score all models against each other and create a plain text score file (MPI required)
convert: convert a plain text score file to a binary score file. This is required by the SEWING movers
```

* "score": edge information (has nothing to do with common rosetta fa/centroid score)
```

<explanation of score file, line 1>
4 and 3 are model_ids (node ids).
67 is the first residue number of sharing (chimeric) segment between two models (this resnum could be different two combinable models).
13 is id of the sharing (chimeric) segment between two models. This 'segment id' is not necessarily same between two combinable models (this 'segment id' could be different between two combinable models).
32 is id of the segment that just precedes the sharing (chimeric) segment between two models.
