## InterfaceScoreCalculator

```
<InterfaceScoreCalculator name=(string) chains=(comma separated chars) scorefxn=(string) native=(string) compute_grid_scores=(bool)/>
```

InterfaceScoreCalculator calculates a myriad of ligand specific scores and appends them to the output file. After scoring the complex the ligand is moved 1000 Ã… away from the protein. The model is then scored again. An interface score is calculated for each score term by subtracting separated energy from complex energy. If compute\_grid\_scores is true, the scores for each grid will be calculated. This may result in the regeneration of the scoring grids, which can be slow. If a native structure is specified, 4 additional score terms are calculated:

1.  ligand\_centroid\_travel. The distance between the native ligand and the ligand in our docked model.
2.  ligand\_radious\_of\_gyration. An outstretched conformation would have a high radius of gyration. Ligands tend to bind in outstretched conformations.
3.  ligand\_rms\_no\_super. RMSD between the native ligand and the docked ligand.
4.  ligand\_rms\_with\_super. RMSD between the native ligand and the docked ligand after aligning the two in XYZ space. This is useful for evaluating how much ligand flexibility was sampled.
