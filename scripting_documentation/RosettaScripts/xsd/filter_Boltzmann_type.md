Compute the boltzmann-weighted sum of positive and negative filter values.

```
<Boltzmann name="(string)" fitness_threshold="(real; 0)" temperature="(real; 0.6)" triage_threshold="(real; -9999)" norm_neg="(bool; false)" positive_filter_names="(string)" negative_filter_names="(string)" anchors="(real_cslist)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   fitness_threshold: Threshold below which fitness must fall
-   temperature: Boltzmann temperature for simulation (kT)
-   triage_threshold: Above this value (e.g. delta score/delta ddg), a negative state will be counted in the Boltzmann fitness calculation. This prevents the dilution of negative states
-   norm_neg: normalize the fitness of the mutation state in relative to the original state. When triage_threshold is used the number of negative states is changed, therefore norm_neg is needed in order to compare mutations in the same position.
-   positive_filter_names: Names of positive filters
-   negative_filter_names: Names of negative filters
-   anchors: Threshold energy values above which positive states really hurt
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
