# ResInInterface
## ResInInterface

Computes the number of residues in the interface specific by jump\_number and if it is above threshold returns true. o/w false. Useful as a quick and ugly filter after docking for making sure that the partners make contact.

```
<ResInInterface name=(riif &string) residues=(20 &integer) jump_number=(1 &integer)/>
