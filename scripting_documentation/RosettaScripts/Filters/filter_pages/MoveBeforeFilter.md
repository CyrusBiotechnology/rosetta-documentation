## MoveBeforeFilter

Apply a given mover to the pose before calculating the results from another filter

```
<MoveBeforeFilter name=(&string) mover=(&string) filter=(&string)/>
```

Note that, like all filters, MoveBeforeFilter cannot change the input pose - the results of the submover will only be used for the subfilter calculation and then discarded.

Also note that caution must be exercised when using a computationally expensive mover or a mover/filter pair which yields stochastic results. The result of the mover is not cached, and will be recomputed for each call to apply(), report() or report\_sm().
