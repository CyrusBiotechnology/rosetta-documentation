-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **nstubs**: Number of hotspot stubs to generate
-   **target_residue_pdb_num**: Residue number from which to generate hot spot stubs; provide this or target_residue_res_num
-   **target_residue_res_num**: Residue number from which to generate hot spot stubs; provide this or target_residue_pdb_num
-   **target_distance**: Interface distance definition
-   **threshold**: Threshold below which stubs are favorable enough in energy to dump
-   **in**: Input for a checkpoint of the hotspot hashing effort
-   **out**: Output where hashed stubs should be stored
-   **hotspot_filter**: Filter to apply to all hotspots before storage


Subtag residue:   Tags describing individual residues hotspots of which are to be hashed

-   **type**: Residue name for consideration
