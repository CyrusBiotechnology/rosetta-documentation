## About
Structural refinement can reveal an ensemble of states describing the conformation of a protein. It is also necessary to advance many low resolution structures determined by x-ray crystallography to atomic-level detail. These refined structures are used as inputs to several modeling protocols such as protein-protein docking, ligand docking, etc. 

## Algorithm Description
The membrane relax application combines the traditional fast relax algorithm with the membrane all atom energy function and an additional step for optimizing the membrane position. To refine the protein structure, several iterations to sample backbone and side chain conformations. In addition, the relative orientation of the membrane and protein is sampled by minimizing the transform in the membrane jump. Combination of high-resolution refinement and orienting the membrane position allows for simultaneous refinement of structure and optimization of membrane embedding. 

## Code and Demo
This application uses the membrane framework and is implemented as a Rosetta script. The script can be found in the Rosetta/demos/protocol_captures/2014/mpframework-relax directory called membrane_relax.xml which is passed to the rosetta_scripts executable. 

## Generating Inputs
### Generating Inputs
The membrane relax application requires 1 input file: 

  1. Generating a Spanfile
  A spanfile describing transmembrane spanning regions can be generated using the OCTOPUS server (http://octopus.cbr.su.se/). This file must be converted to a Rosetta spanfile format using octopus2span.pl. Example command is given below: 

```
cd mpframework-relax/scripts/
./octopus2span.pl octopus_pred.out > spanfile.txt
```

## Example Command Lines
To run this application, use the following command line: 

`./rosetta_scripts.<exe> -database /path/to/my/rosettadb @flags`
