A metric for measuring per-residue SASA and adding it to the resulting score file..

```xml
<PerResidueSasaMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        output_as_pdb_nums="(&string;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **output_as_pdb_nums**: If outputting to scorefile use PDB numbering instead of Rosetta (default)
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we only calculate and output metrics for the subset of residues selected.
