This mover will modify a given task according to a sequence profile and then call the PackRotamersMover. At every position that is designable in the task, AAs that have a probability greater than min_aa_probability_ and higher than the native in the sequence profile will be allowed

```xml
<ConsensusDesignMover name="(&string;)" task_operations="(&string;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" invert_task="(true &bool;)"
        use_seqprof_constraints="(true &bool;)" sasa_cutoff="(1.0 &real;)"
        ignore_pose_profile_length_mismatch="(&bool;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **invert_task**: Operate on the residues specified as non-packable in the PackerTask
-   **use_seqprof_constraints**: use sequence profile constraints
-   **sasa_cutoff**: skip designing residues with SASA lower than this
-   **ignore_pose_profile_length_mismatch**: If true, and the pose/profile mismatch, excess pose residues are marked repackable by SeqprofConsensusOperation.  If false, and they mismatch, it crashes.  If they match, no problems!
