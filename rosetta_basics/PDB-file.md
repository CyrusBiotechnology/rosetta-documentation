#PDB file
##PDB file

The PDB file format is an industry standard file format for storage of biomolecular structures. The [official description](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format) of the file format is kept by the wwPDB.

Rosetta currently only reads a subset of the records in the PDB format.

The major records read are the ATOM and HETATM records that define atom coordinates.

Most other records are ignored.


TODO: Insert comments about the specialty usage of other records
