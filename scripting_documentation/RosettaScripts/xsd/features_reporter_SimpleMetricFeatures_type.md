Run a set of SimpleMetrics on the pose, and put the data into a features table

```xml
<SimpleMetricFeatures name="(&string;)" metrics="(&string;)" prefix="(&string;)"
        suffix="(&string;)" table_name="(simple_metrics &string;)" >
    <Simple Metric Tag ... />
</SimpleMetricFeatures>
```

-   **metrics**: Comma-separated list of previously defined simple_metrics to be added.
-   **prefix**: Prefix tag for the data.  Added as an extra column in the data.
-   **suffix**: suffix tag for the data.  Added as an extra column in the data.
-   **table_name**: The table to add metrics to.  Should match the same exact data that you had before if the table has already been created!


"Simple Metric Tag": Any of the [[SimpleMetrics]]
