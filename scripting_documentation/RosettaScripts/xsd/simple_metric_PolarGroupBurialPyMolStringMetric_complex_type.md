A string metric that generates a string of PyMol commands to colour a structure's polar groups based on burial.

```xml
<PolarGroupBurialPyMolStringMetric name="(&string;)" verbose="(false &bool;)"
        scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **verbose**: If true, this metric outputs to tracer as well as to the pose.  False by default
-   **scorefxn**: (REQUIRED) A scorefunction, defined previously in the RosettaScripts XML, which will be used to extract the buried_unsaturated_penalty's definition of burial.  Required option.
