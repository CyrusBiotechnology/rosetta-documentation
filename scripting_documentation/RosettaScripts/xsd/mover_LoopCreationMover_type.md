-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **loop_inserter**: Mover with which to insert the loop
-   **loop_closer**: Mover with which to close the loop
-   **dump_pdbs**: Should the mover dump PDBs?
-   **refine**: Should the mover do refinement?
-   **attempts_per_anchor**: How many of
-   **minimize_loops**: Should the mover minimize loops?
-   **design_loops**: Also design loops?
-   **include_neighbors**: Should the mover include neighbors in minimization?
-   **loop_anchors**: What residues should serve as loop anchors?
-   **asym_size**: A cryptic, integer option.
-   **filter_by_lam**: Should we filter by the LoopAnalyzer score?
-   **lam_score_cutoff**: If so, what should the score cutoff be?
