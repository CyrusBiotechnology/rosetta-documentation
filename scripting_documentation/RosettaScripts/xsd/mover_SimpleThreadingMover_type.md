This mover functions to thread the sequence of a region onto the given pose. Nothing fancy here. Useful when combined with -parser:string_vars option to replace strings within the RosettaScript. For more a more fancy comparative modeling protocol, please see the lovely RosettaCM

```
<SimpleThreadingMover name="(string)" pack_neighbors="(bool; false)"
        neighbor_dis="(real; 6.0)" start_position="(string)"
        thread_sequence="(string)" scorefxn="(string)"
        skip_unknown_mutant="(bool)" pack_rounds="(non_negative_integer; 5)" />
```

-   **pack_neighbors**: Option to pack neighbors while threading
-   **neighbor_dis**: Distance to repack neighbor side chains. Repack shell distance for each threaded residue
-   **start_position**: Position to start thread. PDB numbering (like 30L) or Rosetta pose numbering. PDB numbering parsed at apply time to allow for pose-length changes prior to apply of this mover
-   **thread_sequence**: One letter amino acid sequence we will be grafting. Currently only works for canonical amino acids
-   **scorefxn**: Optional Scorefunction name passed - setup in score function block
-   **skip_unknown_mutant**: Skip unknown amino acid in thread_sequence string instead of throwing an exception
-   **pack_rounds**: Number of packing rounds for threading
