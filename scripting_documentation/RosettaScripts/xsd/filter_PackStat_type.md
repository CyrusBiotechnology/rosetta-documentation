Calculates packing statistics

```
<PackStat name="(string)" threshold="(real; 0.58)" chain="(non_negative_integer; 0)"
         repeats="(non_negative_integer; 1)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **threshold**: packstat above which filter passes. Common wisdom says 0.65 is a good number.
-   **chain**: jump on which to separate the complex before computing packstat. 0 means not to separate the complex.
-   **repeats**: How many times to repeat the calculation.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
