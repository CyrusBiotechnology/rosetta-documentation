XRW TO DO

```
<SequenceRecovery name="(string)" task_operations="(string)" scorefxn="(string)"
         rate_threshold="(real; 0.0)" mutation_threshold="(non_negative_integer; 100)"

```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **rate_threshold**: Rate of sequence recovery below which the filter fails
-   **mutation_threshold**: Raw number-of-mutations threshold above which the filter fails
-   **report_mutations**: Decide pass/fail based on the mutation threshold, not the rate threshold
-   **verbose**: Give a lot more logging output
-   **write2pdb**: Write each mutation as a string to the output PDB
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
