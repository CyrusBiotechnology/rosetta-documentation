## Overview

Given a starting structure, ConfChangeMover perturbs the protein pose in two steps:                                       
1. Secondary Structure Elements (SSEs) are roto-translated. Optionally, new dihedral angles are sampled through fragments insertion.
2. Loops are closed with fragments insertion. In this step, the intensity of sampling new loops conformations can be tuned through the frequency of inserting fragments taken from the starting structure rather than from the PDB. Higher frequency means more starting conformation fragments and a more conservative sampling.                  
## Minimal steps
Mandatory XML options
```xml
     <ConfChangeMover name="&string" stage1_scorefxn="&sring" stage2_scorefxn="&string" /> 
```
Stage1 and stage2 scoring functions need to be 'centroid'.
Example of stage1 scoring function for membrane proteins used in the paper above:
```
hbond_sr_bb 1.17
hbond_lr_bb 1.17
rama        0.15
omega       0.2
rg          0.1
vdw         1.0
Menv 2.019
Mpair 1.0
Mcbeta 2.5
cenpack_smooth  1.0
cart_bonded     0
rsigma 1.0
sheet 1.0
ss_pair 1.0
hs_pair 1.0
Menv_non_helix 2.019
Menv_termini 2.019
Menv_tm_proj 2.019
cen_hb 1
```
Suggested weights for stage1 in the XML file:
```xml
         <ScoreFunction name="&string" weights="&string" >
                <Reweight scoretype="dihedral_constraint" weight="1" />
                #ANY CONSTRAINTS WEIGHT like 'epr_deer_score', 'atom_pair_constraint' etc.
        </ScoreFunction>
```
Suggested weights for stage2 in the XML file:
```xml
         <ScoreFunction name="&string" weights="&string" >
                <Reweight scoretype="cart_bonded" weight="0.5" />
                <Reweight scoretype="dihedral_constraint" weight="0.1" />
                #ANY CONSTRAINTS WEIGHT like 'epr_deer_score', 'atom_pair_constraint' etc.
        </ScoreFunction>
```

Membrane proteins require a span file to be generated. A spanfile is a file format used by Rosetta for modeling of alpha-helical membrane proteins. It contains the number, length and sequence position of trans-membrane helices. Such information can be retrieved using the sequence-based transmembrane helix prediction tool TOPCONS (https://topcons.cbr.su.se/) from a FASTA file.   
A span file from the TOPCONS output can be generated by using the topcons2span.pl script (https://github.com/davidesala/topcons2span) as follow:
```
perl topcons2span.pl <TOPCONS topology file>
```
Alternatively, a spanfile can be generated following these instructions https://new.rosettacommons.org/docs/wiki/application_documentation/membrane_proteins/RosettaMP-App-MPSpanFromPDB

For soluble proteins, the 'score3' scoring function can be used.
