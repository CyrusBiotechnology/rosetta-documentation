_Autogenerated Tag Syntax Documentation:_

---
Reports the report_sm value of the provided Filter at the time this Mover runs (normally RosettaScripts reports at the end of the run, when the Filter's value will have changed)

```xml
<FilterReportAsPoseExtraScoresMover name="(&string;)" filter_name="(&string;)"
        report_as="(&string;)" />
```

-   **filter_name**: Filter (defined in FILTERS section) to report value of
-   **report_as**: string to report value to (cannot use filter name because RosettaScripts is stupid and reports the filter's ENDING value there already)
