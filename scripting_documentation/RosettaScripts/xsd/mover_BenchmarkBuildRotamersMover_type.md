For benchmarking purposes only. Builds data required to run pack rotamers but does not do any sampling. Input pose is untouched.

```xml
<BenchmarkBuildRotamersMover name="(&string;)"
        nloop="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        task_operations="(&task_operation_comma_separated_list;)" />
```

-   **nloop**: Equivalent to "-ndruns".Number of complete packing runs before an output (best score) is produced.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma separated list of TaskOperations to use.
