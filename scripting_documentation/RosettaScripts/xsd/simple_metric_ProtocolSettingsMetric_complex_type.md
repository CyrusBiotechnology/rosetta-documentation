This Metric reports options that have been set in the command line and splits script_vars.  Each option name is the type and the setting is the value in the map.  This is primarily aimed at benchmarking and record-keeping for large-scale rosetta runs or experiments.
  It works with both the global and local OptionsCollection to enable its use in JD3.  
It is analogous to the ProtocolFeatures reporter, with more options for xml-based variables.

```xml
<ProtocolSettingsMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        base_name_only="(true &bool;)" get_user_options="(true &bool;)"
        get_script_vars="(true &bool;)" limit_to_options="(&string_cslist;)"
        skip_corrections="(true &bool;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **base_name_only**: Use only the base option name instead of the whole path
-   **get_user_options**: Report all set cmd-line options
-   **get_script_vars**: Split script_vars and report
-   **limit_to_options**: Limit reporting to these options (comma-separated list).  Can be user-set or script_vars, but works with the get_user_options and get_script_vars options.
-   **skip_corrections**: Skip ScoreFunction Corrections, which are set in-code at the beginning of a run.
