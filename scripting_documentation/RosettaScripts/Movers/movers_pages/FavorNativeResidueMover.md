## FavorNativeResidue

```
<FavorNativeResidue bonus=(1.5 &bool)/>
```

Adds residue\_type\_constraints to the pose with the given bonus. The name is a slight misnomer -- the "native" residue which is favored is actually the identity of the residue of the current pose at apply time (-in:file:native is not used by this mover).

For more flexible usage see FavorSequenceProfile (with "scaling=prob matrix=IDENTITY", this will show the same native-bonus behavior).
