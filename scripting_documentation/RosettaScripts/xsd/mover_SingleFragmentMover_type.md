Performs a single fragment insertion move on the pose. Respects the restrictions imposed by the user-supplied MoveMap and underlying kinematics of the pose -i.e. FoldTree . By default, all backbone torsions are movable.

-   **fragments**: Fragment file. Fragments are used in the assembly of proteins whether for structure prediction or design, to cut down on the size of the protein-folding search space. They are a core part of the Rosetta design. : Fragment libraries are used by many protocols but are a core part of ab initio.
-   **policy**: Policy object is responsible for choosing from among the possible fragments contained in the fragment file. Currently, two policies are supported-- 'uniform' and 'smooth.' The former chooses uniformly amongst the set of possibilities. The latter chooses the fragment that, if applied, causes minimal distortion to the pose.


Subtag MoveMap:   XRW TO DO

-   **bb**: move backbone torsions?
-   **chi**: move sidechain chi torsions?
-   **jump**: move all jumps?


Subtag Jump:   jumps are the not-chemistry internal coordinate connections between separate parts of your pose

-   **number**: Which jump number (in the FoldTree)
-   **setting**: true for move, false for don't move

Subtag Chain:   this controls a kinematically contiguous chain (think protein chains)

-   **number**: which chain?
-   **chi**: move sidechain chi torsions?
-   **bb**: move backbone torsions?

Subtag Span:   XRW TO DO, probably a user-defined region of the Pose

-   **begin**: beginning of span
-   **end**: end of span
-   **chi**: move sidechain chi torsions?
-   **bb**: move backbone torsions?
-   **bondangle**: move 3-body angles?
-   **bondlenth**: move 2-body lengths?
