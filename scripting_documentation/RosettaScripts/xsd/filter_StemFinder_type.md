Compare a set of homologous but structurally heterogeneous PDBs to a template PDB and find structurally highly conserved sites that can serve as stems for splicing segments

```
<StemFinder name="(string)" from_res="(non_negative_integer; 1)" to_res="(non_negative_integer)"
         rmsd="(real; 0.7)" stems_on_sse="(bool; false)" stems_are_neighbors="(bool; true)"
         neighbor_distance="(real; 4.0)" neighbor_seperation="(non_negative_integer; 10)"
         filenames="(string)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **from_res**: starting template position (in rosetta numbering) in which to search for stems
-   **to_res**: ending template positions (in rosetta numbering) in which to search for stems
-   **rmsd**: cutoff for the average rmsd between a given position in the template and all of the closest positions in the homologs.
-   **stems_on_sse**: demand that in each of the homologs the candidate stems are on 2ary structural elements
-   **stems_are_neighbors**: should we eliminate stems that are farther than neighbor_distance from one another?
-   **neighbor_distance**: minimal atomic distance between any pair of atoms on each of the residues
-   **neighbor_seperation**: minimal aa separation between candidate stem sites
-   **filenames**: PDB structures that are well aligned to the template
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
