Replaces current PDB with one from disk. This is probably only useful in checkpointing, since this mover deletes all information gained so far in the trajectory.

```
<LoadPDB name="(string)"filename="(string)"append="(bool; false)" />

-   **filename**: Path to PDB file
-   **append**: Appends the pose conformation to the current pose by a new jump
