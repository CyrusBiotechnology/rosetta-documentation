Computes the average shortest path length on the 'network' of the single-chain protein topology, considering residues as nodes and peptide and disulfide bonds as edges.

```
<AveragePathLength name="(string)" path_tightness="(real; 1)" max_path_length="(real; 99999)"
         confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **path_tightness**: Tightness of path length threshold; lower values are more stringent
-   **max_path_length**: The absolute maximum, protein-size-independent, to pass the filter for path length.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
