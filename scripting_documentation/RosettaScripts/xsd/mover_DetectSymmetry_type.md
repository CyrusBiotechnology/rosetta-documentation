This mover takes a non-symmetric pose composed of symmetric chains and transforms it into a symmetric system. It only works with cyclic symmetries from C2 to C99.

```
<DetectSymmetry name="(&string;)" subunit_tolerance="(0.01 &real;)"
        plane_tolerance="(1e-3 &real;)" />
```

-   **subunit_tolerance**: Maximum tolerated CA-rmsd between the chains.
-   **plane_tolerance**: Maximum accepted displacement(angstroms) of the center of mass of the whole pose from the xy-plane.
