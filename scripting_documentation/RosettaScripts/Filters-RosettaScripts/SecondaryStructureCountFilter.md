# SecondaryStructureCount
## SecondaryStructureCount

Counts total number of DSSP-defined secondary structure elements of a given type(s).
WARNING: This filter's report_sm (found in scorefile) is always a dummy "0" value regardless of secondary structure count. The total secstruct counts for each sectruct type are listed in the tracer output.

```
<SecondaryStructureCount name=(&string) filter_helix_sheet=(1 &bool) filter_helix=(0 &bool) filter_sheet=(0 &bool) filter_loop=(0 &bool) num_helix==(0 &int) num_sheet==(0 &int) num_loop==(0 &int) min_helix_length=(4 &int) min_sheet_length=(3 &int) min_loop_length=(1 &int) 
```

- filter_helix_sheet: filter on sum of helix and sheet?
- (the rest are pretty self-explanatory)
