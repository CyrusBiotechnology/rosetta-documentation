```
<TryRotamers name="(string)" pdb_num="(residue_number)" res_num="(non_negative_integer)"
         automatic_connection="(bool; 1)" scorefxn="(string)" jump_num="(non_negative_integer; 1)"
         solo_res="(bool; 1)" final_filter="(string; true_filter)" clash_check="(bool; 0)"

```

-   **pdb_num**: Residue number in PDB numbering (residue number + chain ID)
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **automatic_connection**: Automatically set up a hotspot foldtree
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **jump_num**: Jump across which to evaluate energies, numbered sequentially from one
-   **solo_res**: Add terminal types (upper and lower) to the hotspot residue
-   **final_filter**: Add terminal types (upper and lower) to the hotspot residue
-   **clash_check**: Perform a clash check and filter out clashing rotamers (helps with speed!)
-   **include_current**: Include input conformation
-   **explosion**: Aggression with which to sample conformations, 0-4 (values more than four are equivalent thereto)
-   **shove**: List of residues for which to use the shove type, given in refpose, pose, or PDB numbering
