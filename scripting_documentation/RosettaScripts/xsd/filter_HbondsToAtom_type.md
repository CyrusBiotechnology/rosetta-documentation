This filter counts the number of residues that form sufficiently energetically favorable H-bonds to a selected atom

```
<HbondsToAtom name="(string)"partners="(non_negative_integer)"
        energy_cutoff="(real; -0.5)"bb_bb="(bool; 0)"backbone="(bool; 0)"
        sidechain="(bool; 1)"pdb_num="(refpose_enabled_residue_number)"
        atomname="(string)"res_num="(non_negative_integer)"
        confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **partners**: H-bonding partner expectation, below which counts as failure
-   **energy_cutoff**: Energy below which a H-bond counts
-   **bb_bb**: Count backbone-backbone H-bonds
-   **backbone**: Count backbone H-bonds
-   **sidechain**: Count sidechain H-bonds
-   **pdb_num**: Particular residue of interest
-   **atomname**: Atom name to which to examine H-bonds
-   **res_num**: Residue number in Rosetta numbering (sequentially with the first residue in the pose being 1
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
