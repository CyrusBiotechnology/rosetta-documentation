Calculate the number of heavy atoms clashing between building blocks.

```
<ClashCheck name="(string)"clash_dist="(real; 3.5)"
        sym_dof_names="(string; XRW TO DO)"
        nsub_bblock="(non_negative_integer; 1)"
        cutoff="(non_negative_integer; 0)"verbose="(bool; 0)"
        write2pdb="(bool; 0)"task_operations="(string)"confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **clash_dist**: Distance between heavy atoms below which they are considered to be clashing. Note: A hard-coded cutoff of 2.6 is set for contacts between backbone carbonyl oxygens and nitrogens for bb-bb hbonds.
-   **sym_dof_names**: Only use with multicomponent systems. Comma-separated list of name(s) of the sym_dof(s) corresponding to the building block(s) between which to check for clashes.
-   **nsub_bblock**: The number of subunits in the symmetric building block. Does not need to be set for multicomponent systems.
-   **cutoff**: Maximum number of allowable clashes.
-   **verbose**: If set to true, then will output a pymol selection string to the logfile with the clashing positions/atoms.
-   **write2pdb**: If set to true, then will output a pymol selection string to the output pdb with the clashing positions/atoms.
-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
