Filter on the proportion of residues with a secondary structure assignment (i.e., not loop)

```
<SSamount name="(string)" reference_name="(string)" chain="(char)" upper_threshold="(real; 1.0)"
         lower_threshold="(real; 0.5)" discard_lonely_SS="(non_negative_integer)"
         confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **chain**: Chain over which to calculate the filter
-   **upper_threshold**: Upper threshold above which the filter would return false
-   **lower_threshold**: Lower threshold above which the filter would return false
-   **discard_lonely_SS**: Score poses with only one SS element as -1.0
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
