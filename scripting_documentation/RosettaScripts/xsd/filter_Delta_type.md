Computes the difference in a filter's value compared to the input structure

```
<Delta name="(&string;)" range="(0.0 &real;)" lower="(false &bool;)"
        upper="(true &bool;)" filter="(&string;)" relax_mover="(null &string;)"
        unbound="(false &bool;)" relax_unbound="(false &bool;)"
        changing_baseline="(false &bool;)" scorefxn="(&string;)"
        jump="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" reference_name="(&string;)"
        reference_pdb="(XRW TO DO &string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **range**: how much above/below the baseline to allow?
-   **lower**: the threshold is upper/lower? Use both if the threshold is an exact value.
-   **upper**: the threshold is upper/lower? Use both if the threshold is an exact value.
-   **filter**: the name of a predefined filter for evaluation.
-   **relax_mover**: called at parse-time before setting the baseline.
-   **unbound**: translates the partners by 10000A before evaluating the baseline and the filters. Allows evaluation of the unbound pose.
-   **relax_unbound**: relax the unbound state w/ relax mover?
-   **changing_baseline**: reset baseline value to current value after every accept
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **jump**: if unbound is set, this can be used to set the jump along which to translate.
-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **reference_pdb**: use reference pose from disk
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
