Rosetta is a very hungry program in terms of computer time.
This is partly because protein modeling is about the [[hardest problem|http://xkcd.com/1430/]] we know.
It is partly because Rosetta is largely written by professional biophysicists who are less experienced at software engineering and totally inexperienced with [[optimizing|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization]] algorithms for speed.
(That said, the [[inner loops|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_loop]] really are quite optimized by people who knew what they were doing!)
