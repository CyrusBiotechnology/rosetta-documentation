Select residues that have a good electron density fit. (Or bad fit using the invert option). Uses internal density tools to do so.  Numbers and cutoffs match well with Coot's density fit analysis tool. Zscore uses weighted sum of density, density-compared-to-neighbors, rama (where applicable) and cart_bonded to compute)  Correlation is same values used to calculate density scores.  Zscore reference is here: eLife 2016, Dimaio

```xml
<DensityFitResidueSelector name="(&string;)" invert="(false &bool;)"
        cutoff="(-.5 &real;)" sliding_window_size="(3 &positive_integer;)"
        mixed_sliding_window="(false &bool;)" match_res="(false &bool;)"
        use_native="(false &bool;)" use_selector_as_zscore_mask="(true &bool;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **invert**: Select residues that have a bad density fit instead of those with good density fit.
-   **cutoff**: Cutoff of bad match to density
-   **sliding_window_size**: Sliding window size for density calculation
-   **mixed_sliding_window**: Use a window size of 3 for protein and 1 for glycans.  May skew results.
-   **match_res**: Use density correlation instead of a zscore to fit to density
-   **use_native**: Use a native set with in:file:native to do the selection for benchmarking purposes.
-   **use_selector_as_zscore_mask**: Use the selector as true mask to calculate the Zscore.  Otherwise, use it just as a selection for result.  Default true.
-   **residue_selector**: A Residue selector mask.  Used to only compute Zscore among a set of residues.  Useful for protein vs glycan density.  Since match_res is NOT a zscore, the selector acts as an AND selector, so we only compute the correlations on this set.
