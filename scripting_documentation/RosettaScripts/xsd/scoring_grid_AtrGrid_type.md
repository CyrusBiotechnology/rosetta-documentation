A scoring grid that gives bonuses for being within a certain distance range of an atom -- that is, between the inner radius to outer radius distances

```
<AtrGrid name="(string)" bb="(real)" sc="(real)" ligand="(real)"
        inner_radius="(real)" outer_radius="(real)" weight="(real)" />
```

-   **bb**: The value assigned to the grid for backbone atoms; negative values are considered favorable. If provided, then both 'sc' and 'ligand' attributes need to be provided also
-   **sc**: The value assigned to the grid for sidechain atoms; negative values are considered favorable. If provided, then both 'bb' and 'ligand' attributes need to be provided also
-   **ligand**: The value assigned to the grid for ligand atoms; negative values are considered favorable. If provided, then both 'bb' and 'sc' attributes need to be provided also
-   **inner_radius**: The size of the inner radius used when defining the grid, in Angstroms; if provided, then 'outer_radius' attribute must be provided also; a default value of 2.25A is used if not provided
-   **outer_radius**: The size of hte outer radius used when defining the grid, in Angstroms; if provided, then the 'inner_radius' attribute must be provided also; a default value of 4.75A
-   **weight**: XRW TO DO
