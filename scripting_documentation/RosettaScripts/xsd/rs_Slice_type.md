Residue selector that allows slicing of the selection of other residue selections. Also allows negative indexing. 1 is the first residue and -1 is the last.

```xml
<Slice name="(&string;)" selector="(&string;)" from="(0 &integer;)"
        to="(1 &integer;)" indices="(&string;)" slice_mode="(SPARSE &string;)"
        oob_mode="(ERROR &string;)" >
    <Residue Selector Tag ... />
</Slice>
```

-   **selector**: The selector to slice from.
-   **from**: Range selection: This is the first residue of the range to select.
-   **to**: Range selection: This is the last residue of the range to select.
-   **indices**: Index selection: Comma separated list of indices. May not use this with from-to
-   **slice_mode**: How should the previous residue selector be represented? SPARSE: all gaps are removed from the previous selection. If residues 101 and 200 are selected, only indices 1 and 2 are valid. CONTIGUOUS: gaps from previous selection are included in indices. If residues 101 and 200 are selected, all indices from 1 to 100 are valid.
-   **oob_mode**: If an index is out of bounds, how should this be handled? ERROR: Quit and display error message. WARN: Display error message. IGNORE: Ignore.
