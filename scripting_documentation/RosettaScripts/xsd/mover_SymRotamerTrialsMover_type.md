This mover goes through each repackable/redesignable position in the pose, taking every permitted rotamer in turn, and evaluating the energy. Each position is then updated to the lowest energy rotamer. It does not consider coordinated changes at multiple residues, and may need several invocations to reach convergence.

```xml
<SymRotamerTrialsMover name="(&string;)" show_packer_task="(false &bool;)"

```

-   **show_packer_task**: XRW TO DO
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
-   **task_operations**: A comma separated list of TaskOperations to use.
