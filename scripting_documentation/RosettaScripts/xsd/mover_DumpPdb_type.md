_Autogenerated Tag Syntax Documentation:_

---
Dumps a pdb. Recommended ONLY for debugging as you can't change the name of the file during a run, although if tag_time is true a timestamp with second resolution will be added to the filename, allowing for a limited amount of multi-dumping. If scorefxn is specified, a scored pdb will be dumped.

```
<DumpPdb name="(string)" fname="(string; dump.pdb)" tag_time="(bool; false)" scorefxn="(string)" />
```

-   fname: Filename of dumped PDB.
-   tag_time: If true, adds timestamp to name of pdb file.
-   scorefxn: XRW TO DO
