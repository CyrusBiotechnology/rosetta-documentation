Determines mutated residues in current pose as compared to a reference pose

```
<Mutations name="(string)" task_operations="(string)" rate_threshold="(real; 0.0)" mutation_threshold="(non_negative_integer; 100)" report_mutations="(bool; 0)" verbose="(bool; 0)" packable="(bool; 0)" write2pdb="(bool; 0)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   task_operations: XRW TO DO
-   rate_threshold: Lower cutoff for the acceptable recovery rate for a passing design. Will fail if actual rate is below this threshold.
-   mutation_threshold: Upper cutoff for the number of mutations for an acceptable design. Only matters if report_mutations is set to true.
-   report_mutations: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will act as a filter for the number of mutations rather than the rate.
-   verbose: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will output the mutated positions and identities to the tracer.
-   packable: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will also consider mutations at packable positions in addition to designable positions.
-   write2pdb: Defaults to false. If set to true, then will output the mutated positions and identities to the output pdb.
-   confidence: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
