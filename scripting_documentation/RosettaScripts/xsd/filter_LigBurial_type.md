this filter basically works exactly as ResidueBurialFilter, but with the advantage that it has the capability to figure out resid of the ligand

```
<LigBurial name="(string)" lig_id="(non_negative_integer; 0)" distance="(real; 8.0)"
         neighbors="(non_negative_integer; 0)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **lig_id**: an input other than 0 (or no input at all) indicates no ligand present
-   **distance**: distance around which the ligand to count neighboring atoms
-   **neighbors**: integer representing the number of neighbors count
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
