```xml
<SpecificResiduesNearInterface name="(&string;)" task_operations="(&string;)"
        jump_number="(1 &non_negative_integer;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **jump_number**: Jump across which to define the interface
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
