# RosetaMP Applications: Score JD2 Extension

## Code and Demo
This application uses Movers from RosettaMP. The score_jd2 application can be found at `public/analysis/score_jd2.cc`. The supplement of the above manuscript also outlines its use. 

## Algorithm Description
Scoring a membrane protein pose with a defined score function is one of the most basic and much needed functionality. For this, we hijacked the score_jd2 application and made it (at least partly) applicable for membrane proteins. 

## Run the application

There are two modes available for this application: 

**1) Having a fixed membrane and a fixed protein.** This requires the protein structure already be transformed into membrane coordinates (see [https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/wiki/PDB-file](https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/wiki/PDB-file) on how to do this) and currently only works if a spanfile is given, which can be generated from the transformed structure (see XXX). Example flags: 

```
Rosetta/main/source/bin/score_jd2.macosclangrelease \
-database Rosetta/main/database \
-in:file:s 1AFO_tr.pdb \
-in:membrane \
-mp:setup:spanfiles 1AFO__tr.span \
-score:weights mpframework_smooth_fa_2012.wts \
```

**2) Having a fixed membrane a movable protein.** This does not require the protein to be transformed into membrane coordinates and works with a regular cleaned PDB file. However, it requires a spanfile as input. Example flags: 

```
Rosetta/main/source/bin/score_jd2.macosclangrelease \
-database Rosetta/main/database \
-in:file:s 1AFO.pdb \
-in:membrane \
-mp:setup:spanfiles 1AFO__tr.span \
-mp:setup:transform_into_membrane \
-score:weights mpframework_smooth_fa_2012.wts \
```

Both applications only score the protein and don't optimize the membrane position!
Note: Make sure your numbering between PDB file and spanfile match!
