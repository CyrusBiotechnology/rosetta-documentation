filters energies where ligand is in the interface

```
<LigInterfaceEnergy name="(string)" scorefxn="(string)" energy_cutoff="(real; 0.0)"
         include_cstE="(bool; 0)" jump_number="(non_negative_integer; 0)" interface_distance_cutoff="(real; 8.0)"
         confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **energy_cutoff**: energy threshold for filter
-   **include_cstE**: boolean as to whether to include the cstE
-   **jump_number**: If rb_jump_ is unset, determine jump number according to the number of jumps currently in the pose previously, if this filter was used in RosettaScripts, rb_jump_ was initialized to jump number according to the number of jumps in the pose when the XML was parsed. This enables adding a ligand to the pose after the XML is parsed
-   **interface_distance_cutoff**: used to determine if the ligand is in the interface?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
