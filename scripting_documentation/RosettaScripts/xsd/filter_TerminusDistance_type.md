True, if all residues in the interface are more than n residues from the N or C terminus --i.e. distance in sequence space. If fails, reports how far failing residue was from the terminus. If passes, returns '1000'.

```
<TerminusDistance name="(string)" jump_number="(positive_integer; 1)"
        distance="(non_negative_integer; 5)" confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **jump_number**: Which jump to use for calculating the interface?
-   **distance**: How many residues must each interface residue be from a terminus in sequence distance?
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
