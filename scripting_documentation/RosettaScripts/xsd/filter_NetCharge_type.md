---
This filter sums up all of the positively and negatively charged amino acids in your structure and reports a simplistic sequence-based net charge.

```
<NetCharge name="(&string;)" chain="(0 &non_negative_integer;)"
        max="(100 &integer;)" min="(-100 &integer;)"
        task_operations="(&string;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **chain**: specify which chain you want to calculate the net charge (In the input PDB file, from top to bottom: 1 means first chain, 2 means the second chain, and so forth). Use the value 0 (default) if you want to consider all residues in the input PDB structure.
-   **max**: maximum net charge desired
-   **min**: minimum net charge desired
-   **task_operations**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
