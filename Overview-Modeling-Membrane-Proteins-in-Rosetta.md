## About

Modeling membrane proteins in Rosetta is guided by the Rosetta Membrane Framework. This framework provides a general representation of the membrane along with scoring functions and adapted sampling techniques to model proteins in the membrane bilayer. 

Much of Rosetta is designed for modeling proteins in solution. However, there is a growing need for computational methods that model proteins in the membrane bilayer. In 2006 and 2007, Yarov et al. and Barth et al. implemented a low- and high-resolution scoring function and method for _de novo_ folding of membrane proteins.
