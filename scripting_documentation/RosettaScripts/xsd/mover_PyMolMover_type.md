PyMolMover will send a pose to an instance of the PyMol molecular visualization software running on the local host. Each call of the mover overwrites the object in PyMol. It is not a full featured as the version built in to PyRosetta but is extremely useful for visualizing the flow of a protocol or generating a frames for a movie of a protocol.

```xml
<PyMolMover name="(&string;)" keep_history="(0 &bool;)" />
```

-   **keep_history**: Each call to the mover stores the pose in a new state/frame of an object in PyMol rather than overwriting it. Frames can then be played back like a movie to visualize the flow of a protocol.
