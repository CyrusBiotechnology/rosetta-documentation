Simple RMSD filter for the whole pose, or at least a single chain

```xml
<RmsdSimple name="(&string;)" reference_name="(&string;)" chain="(&char;)"
        threshold="(&real;)" align="(&bool;)" confidence="(1.0 &real;)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **chain**: Chain for RMSD calculation
-   **threshold**: Threshold of RMSD above which the filter fails
-   **align**: If align is true, we do RMSD; if it is false, we don't actually do any alignment, just calculating the distance between pose and reference.
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
