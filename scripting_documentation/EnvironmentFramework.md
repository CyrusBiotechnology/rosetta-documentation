The Environment framework, also known as the ToplogyBroker, is a tool for generating larger, more complex simulation systems out of small interchangeable parts. The intent is to make rapid protocol development in RosettaScript easier by allowing sampling strategies to be carried out simultaneously rather than in sequence by constructing a consensus FoldTree that satisfies all movers. Such Movers inherit from the ClaimingMover (CM) class.

# For the User
There are a few currently available ClaimingMovers (abbreviated CM) that are ready to go:
* UniformRigidBodyCM
* FragmentCM
* FragmentJumpCM
* LoopCM
*
