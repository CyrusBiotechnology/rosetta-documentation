Calculates an interface rmsd. Rmsd is calculated over all backbone atoms for those residues found in the interface of the reference structure. Interface residues are those residues which are within 8 Angstroms of any residue on the other side of the interface.

```
<IRmsd name="(string)"reference_name="(string)"threshold="(real; 5)"
        jump="(non_negative_integer; 1)"scorefxn="(string)"
        confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **reference_name**: XRW_TODO
-   **threshold**: RMSD threshold above which we would fail the filter
-   **jump**: Jump for calculating docking RMSD, numbered sequentially from 1
-   **scorefxn**: XRW TO DO
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
