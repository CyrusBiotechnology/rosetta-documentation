Filter for measuring minimum distance from any sidechain atom in a residue to the closest water molecule

```
<ResidueDepth name="(string)" mindist="(real; 0.0)" maxdist="(real; 99.0)"
        dcut1="(real; 2.6)" dcut2="(real; 4.2)" evalres="(bool_cslist)"
        confidence="(real; 1.0)" />
```

-   **mindist**: Minimal distance between sidechain atom and water molecule
-   **maxdist**: maximum distance between sidechain and water molecule
-   **dcut1**: XSD XRW TO DO
-   **dcut2**: XRW TO DO
-   **evalres**: Residues to evalute
-   **confidence**: Probability that the pose will be filtered out if it does not pass this Filter
