#utility::vector1 Class Reference

Detailed Description
--------------------

vector1 is a [[vectorL]] with the lower index set to 1.

 Note   
-   std::vector with 1-based indexing and a few extras
-   Can construct and assign from std::vector and swap with std::vector
-   Can compare with std::vector: compares contents ignoring indexes
-   Can explicitly convert to std::vector
-   Public inheritance from concrete [[vectorL]] template is safe here
