Select residues that have a good electron density fit. (Or bad fit using the invert option)

```xml
<DensityFitResidueSelector name="(&string;)" invert="(false &bool;)"
        cutoff="(-.5 &real;)" sliding_window_size="(3 &positive_integer;)"
        mixed_sliding_window="(false &bool;)" match_res="(false &bool;)"
        use_selector_as_mask="(true &bool;)" residue_selector="(&string;)" />
```

-   **invert**: Select residues that have a bad density fit instead of those with good density fit.
-   **cutoff**: Cutoff of bad match to density
-   **sliding_window_size**: Sliding window size for density calculation
-   **mixed_sliding_window**: Use a window size of 3 for protein and 1 for glycans.  May skew results.
-   **match_res**: Use density correlation instead of a zscore to fit to density
-   **use_selector_as_mask**: Use the selector as true mask to calculate the Zscore.  Otherwise, use it just as a selection for computation.  Default true.
-   **residue_selector**: A Residue selector mask.  Used to only compute Zscore among a set of residues.  Useful for protein vs glycan density.  Since match_res is NOT a zscore, the selector acts as an AND selector, so we only compute the correlations on this set.
