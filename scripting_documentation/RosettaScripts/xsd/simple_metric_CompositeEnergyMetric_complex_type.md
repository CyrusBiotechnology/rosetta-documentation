A metric to report/calculate all of the energies of a scorefunction that are not 0 or the delta of each energy between another input pose or the set native.

```xml
<CompositeEnergyMetric name="(&string;)" custom_type="(&string;)"
        reference_name="(&string;)" use_native="(false &bool;)"
        residue_selector="(&string;)" scorefxn="(&string;)" />
```

-   **custom_type**: Additional setting to prefix/suffix so that many different configured SMs can be called in one RunSimpleMetric run
  Output data name will be prefix+custom_type+type+suffix
-   **reference_name**: Name of reference pose to use
-   **use_native**: Use the native if present on the cmd-line.
-   **residue_selector**: If a residue selector is present, we calculate each energy component for only these residues.
-   **scorefxn**: Name of score function to use
